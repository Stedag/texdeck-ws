[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an open source flashcard management and active recall tool for PC/Mac/Linux/Mobile.

Notes collated in the texdeck repository will follow a simple format so that they can be efficiently transformed into flashcards.

Alternatively, select builds of Creative Commons flashcards will be downloadable below on this page.

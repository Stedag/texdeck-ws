# Introduction to Tex Decks!

TexDeck.net is a collection of resources assembled to make LaTeX rich flashcards easier to write, remix, and organize.

The effect: Low cost active learning, allowing one's knowledge of science to scale sustainably.

A [[case study]] is in progress to seed the flashcard repository using a course in [nanoelectronics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-701-introduction-to-nanoelectronics-spring-2010/) from [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

All work is [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) unless otherwise specified at the top of a page. I cannot really enforce the attribution clause, but I do highly reccomend it. If you find these resources useful, consider sharing them with others.

Also, keep in mind that this is a work in progress and may contain errors. [Pull requests on these study resources](https://github.com/Stedag/ocwphy) are encouraged.

Despite accumulating a good deal of notes as part of my B.S. I will not include any of school notes among these resources to honor copyright agreements with my department. Nonetheless I forsee monotonic aggregation of resources organized around OCW classes or open-access textbooks.

For any concerns regarding IP, open an issue on github.

The two electrons of He occupy the 1s orbital with opposite spins. The filled orbital makes this noble gas particularly inert. There is still a van der Waals attraction between two He atoms, but the interatomic potential has a shallow minimum of depth $9^{\\circ} K$ at a separation of roughly $3 \\AA$. The weakness of this interaction makes He a powerful wetting agent. As the He atoms have a stronger attraction for practically all other molecules, they easily spread over the surface of any substance. Due to its light mass, the He atom undergoes large zero point fluctuations at $T=0 .$ These fluctuations are sufficient to melt a solid phase, and thus He remains in a liquid state at ordinary pressures. Pressures of over 25 atmosphere are required to sufficiently localize the He atoms to result in a solid phase at $T=0 .$ A remarkable property of the quantum liquid at zero temperature is that, unlike its classical counterpart, it has zero entropy.\n\nThe lighter isotope of $\\mathrm{He}^{3}$ has three nucleons and obeys fermi statistics. The liquid phase is very well described by a fermi gas of the type discussed in sec. VII.E. The interactions between atoms do not significantly change the non-interacting picture described earlier. By contrast, the heavier isotope of $\\mathrm{He}^{4}$ is a boson. Helium can be cooled down by a process of evaporation: Liquid helium is placed in an isolated container, in equilibrium with the gas phase at a finite vapor density. As the helium gas is pumped out, part of the liquid evaporates to take its place. The evaporation process is accompanied by the release of latent heat which cools the liquid. The boiling liquid is quite active and turbulent, just as a boiling pot of water. However, when the liquid is cooled down to below $2.2^{\\circ} K$, it suddenly becomes quiescent and the turbulence disappears. The liquids on the two sides of this phase transition are usually referred to as HeI and HeII.\n\nHeII has unusual hydrodynamic properties. It flows through the finest capillaries without any resistance. Consider an experiment that pushes HeII from one container to another through a small tube packed with powder. For ordinary fluids a finite pressure difference between the containers, proportional to viscosity, is necessary to maintain the flow. HeII flows even in the limit of zero pressure difference and acts as if it has zero viscosity. For this reason it is referred to as a superfluid. The superflow is accompanied by heating of the container that loses HeII and cooling of the container that accepts it; the mechano-caloric effect. Conversely, HeII acts to remove temperature differences by flowing away from hot regions. This is the basis of the fountain effect in which the superfluid spontaneously moves up a tube from a heated container. In some other circumstances HeII behaves as a viscous fluid. A classical method for measuring the viscosity of a liquid is via torsional oscillators: A collection of closely spaced disks connected to a shaft is immersed in the fluid and made to oscillate. The period of oscillations is proportional to the moment of inertia, which is modified by the quantity of fluid that is dragged by the oscillator. This experiment was performed on HeII by Andronikashvilli who indeed found a finite viscous drag. Furthermore, the changes in the frequency of the oscillator with temperature indicate that the quantity of fluid that is dragged by the oscillator starts to decrease below the transition temperature. The measured normal density vanishes as $T \\rightarrow 0$, approximately as $T^{4}$.\n\nIn 1938, Fritz London suggested that a good starting hypothesis is that the transition to the superfluid state is related to the Bose-Einstein condensation. This hypothesis can account for a number of observations:\n\n(1) The critical temperature of an ideal bose gas of volume $v=46.2 \\AA$ per particle is obtained from eq.(VII.55) as\n\n$$\nT_{c}=\\frac{h^{2}}{2 \\pi m_{\\mathrm{He}} k_{B}}\\left(v \\zeta_{3 / 2}\\right)^{-2 / 3} \\approx 3.14^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}\n$$\n\nThe actual transition temperature of $T_{c} \\approx 2.18^{\\circ} K$ is not far from this value.\n\n(2) The origin of the transition has to be related to quantum statistics as $\\mathrm{He}^{3}$, which is atomically similar, but a fermion, does not have a similar transition. (Actually $\\mathrm{He}^{3}$ does become superfluid but at temperatures of only a few $\\mathrm{m}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{K}$. This follows a pairing of $\\mathrm{He}^{3}$ atoms which changes their statistics.)\n\n(3) A bose condensate can account for the observed thermo-mechanical properties of HeII. The expression for pressure in eq.(VII.56) is only a function of temperature, and not density. As such, variations in pressure are accompanied by changes in temperature. This is also the reason for the absence of boiling activity in HeII. Bubbles nucleate and grow in a boiling liquid at local hot spots. In an ordinary fluid, variations in temperature relax to equilibrium only through the slow process of heat diffusion. By contrast if the local pressure is a function of temperature only, there will be increased pressure at a hot spot. The fluid flows in response to pressure gradients and removes them very rapidly (at the speed of sound in the medium).\n\n(4) Hydrodynamic behavior of HeII can be explained by Tisza's two-fluid model, which postulates the coexistence of two components for $T<T_{C}:$\n\n(a) A normal component of density $\\rho_{n}$, moving with velocity $\\vec{v}_{n}$, and having a finite entropy density $s_{n}$. (b) A superfluid component of density $\\rho_{s}$, which flows without viscosity and with no vorticity $\\left(\\nabla \\times \\vec{u}_{s}=0\\right)$, and has zero entropy density, $s_{s}=0$\n\nIn the super-leak experiments, it is the superfluid component that passes through, reducing the entropy and hence temperature. In the Andronikashilli experiment, the normal component sticks to the torsional oscillator and gets dragged by it. This experiment thus gives the ratio of $\\rho_{n}$ to $\\rho_{s}$\n\nThere are, however, many important differences between superfluid helium and the ideal bose condensate:\n\n(1) Interactions certainly play an important role in the liquid state. The Bose-Einstein condensate has infinite compressibility, while HeII has a finite density, related to atomic volume, and is essentially incompressible.\n\n(2) It can be shown that, even at $T=0$, the ideal bose condensate is not superfluid. This is because the low energy spectrum, $\\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k})=\\hbar^{2} k^{2} / 2 m$, admits too many excitations. Any external body moving through such a fluid can easily lose energy to it by exciting these modes, leading to a finite viscosity.\n\n(3) The detailed functional forms of the heat capacity and superfluid density are very different from their counterparts in the ideal bose condensate. The measured heat capacity diverges at the transition with a characteristic shape similar to a $\\lambda$, and vanishes at low temperatures as $T^{3}$ (compared to $T^{3 / 2}$ for the ideal bose gas). The superfluid density obtained in the Andronikashvilli experiment vanishes as $\\left(T_{c}-T\\right)^{2 / 3}$ at the transition, while the normal component vanishes as approximately $T^{4}$ as $T \\rightarrow 0$ (compared to $T^{3 / 2}$ for the condensate density in eq.(VII.53)). Understanding the nature of the singular behavior close to $T_{c}$ is beyond the scope of this discussion. The behavior close to zero temperature, however, suggests a different spectrum of low energy excitations.\n\nBased on the shape of the experimentally measured heat capacity, Landau suggested that the spectrum of low energy excitations is actually similar to that of phonons. This is a consequence of the interactions between the particles. The low energy excitations of a classical liquid are longitudinal sound waves. (In comparison, a solid admits three such excitations, two transverse and one longitudinal.) The correspondence principle suggests that quantized versions of such modes should also be present in a quantum liquid. As in the case of phonons, a linear spectrum of excitations leads to a heat capacity that vanishes as $T^{3} .$ The speed of sound waves can be computed from the coefficient of the $T^{3}$ dependence as $v \\approx 240 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1} .$ A further anomaly in heat capacity can be explained by assuming that the spectrum of excitations bends down and has a minimum in the vicinity of a wavenumber $k_{0} \\approx 2 \\AA^{-1} .$ The excitations in the vicinity of this minimum are referred to as rotons, and have an energy\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text {roton }}(\\vec{k})=\\Delta+\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 \\mu}\\left(k-k_{0}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nwith $\\Delta \\approx 8.6^{\\circ} K$, and $\\mu \\approx 0.16 m_{\\mathrm{He}} .$ The spectrum postulated by Landau was confirmed directly by neutron scattering measurements in the 1950 's.

In the degenerate quantum limit, $\\mu$ approaches its limiting value of zero. To see how this limit is achieved, and to find out about the behavior of the degenerate bose gas, we have to examine the limiting behavior of the functions $f_{m}^{+}(z)$ in eqs.(VII.35) as $z=\\exp (\\beta \\mu)$ goes to unity.\n\nThe functions $f_{m}^{+}(z)$ are monotonically increasing with $z$ in the interval $0 \\leq z \\leq 1$ The maximum value attained at $z=1$ is\n\n$$\n\\zeta_{m} \\equiv f_{m}^{+}(1)=\\frac{1}{(m-1) !} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d x x^{m-1}}{e^{x}-1}\n$$\n\nThe integrand has a pole as $x \\rightarrow 0$, where it behaves as $\\int d x x^{m-2} .$ Therefore, $\\zeta_{m}$ is finite for $m>1$ and infinite for $m<1 .$ A useful recursive property of these functions is (for $m>1)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{d z} f_{m}^{+}(z) &=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d x \\frac{x^{m-1}}{(m-1) !} \\frac{d}{d z}\\left(\\frac{1}{z^{-1} e^{x}-1}\\right) \\\\\n\\left(\\text { use } \\frac{d}{d z} f\\left(z^{-1} e^{x}\\right)=-\\frac{e^{x}}{z^{2}} f^{\\prime}=-\\frac{1}{z} \\frac{d}{d x} f\\left(z^{-1} e^{x}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\frac{1}{z} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d x \\frac{x^{m-1}}{(m-1) !} \\frac{d}{d x}\\left(\\frac{1}{z^{-1} e^{x}-1}\\right) \\quad \\text { (integrate by parts) } \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{z} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d x \\frac{x^{m-2}}{(m-2) !} \\frac{1}{z^{-1} e^{x}-1}=\\frac{1}{z} f_{m-1}^{+}(z)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, a sufficiently high derivative of $f_{m}^{+}(z)$ will be divergent at $z=1$ for all $m$.\n\nThe density of excited states for the non-relativistic bose gas in three dimensions is thus bounded by\n\n$$\nn_{\\times}=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z) \\leq n^{*}=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\zeta_{3 / 2}\n$$\n\nAt sufficiently high temperatures, such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{n \\lambda^{3}}{g}=\\frac{n}{g}\\left(\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_{B} T}}\\right)^{3} \\leq \\zeta_{3 / 2} \\approx 2.612 \\cdots\n$$\n\nthis bound is not relevant and $n_{\\times}=n .$ However, on lowering temperature, the limiting density of excited states is achieved at\n\n$$\nT_{c}(n)=\\frac{h^{2}}{2 \\pi m k_{B}}\\left(\\frac{n}{g \\zeta_{3 / 2}}\\right)^{2 / 3}\n$$\n\nFor $T \\leq T_{c}, z$ gets stuck to unity $(\\mu=0)$. The limiting density of excited states, $n^{*}=g \\zeta_{3 / 2} / \\lambda^{3} \\propto T^{3 / 2}$, is then less than the total particle density. The remaining gas particles, with density $n_{0}=n-n^{*}$, occupy the lowest energy state with $\\vec{k}=0 .$ The phenomenon of a macroscopic occupation of a single one- particle state is known as BoseEinstein condensation.\n\nThe bose condensate has some unusual properties. The gas pressure for $T<T_{c}$,\n\n$$\n\\beta P=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} f_{5 / 2}^{+}(1)=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\zeta_{5 / 2} \\approx 1.341 \\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}}\n$$\n\nvanishes as $T^{5 / 2}$ and is independent of density. This is because only the excited fraction $n^{*}$ has finite momentum and contributes to the pressure. Alternatively, bose condensation can be achieved at a fixed temperature by increasing density (reducing volume). From eq.(VII.54), the transition occurs at a specific volume\n\n$$\nv^{*}=\\frac{1}{n^{*}}=\\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{g \\zeta_{3 / 2}}\n$$\n\nFor $v<v^{*}$, the pressure-volume isotherm is flat, since $\\partial P / \\partial v \\propto \\partial P / \\partial n=0$ from eq.(VII.56). The flat portion of isotherms is reminiscent of coexisting liquid and gas phases. We can similarly regard bose condensation as the coexistence of a \"normal gas\" of specific volume $v^{*}$, and a \"liquid\" of volume $0 .$ The vanishing of the \"liquid\" volume is an unrealistic feature due to the absence of any interaction potential between the particles.\n\nBose condensation combines features of discontinuous (first order), and continuous (second order) transitions; there is a finite latent heat while the compressibility diverges. The latent heat of the transition can be obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which gives the change of the transition temperature with pressure as\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d T}{d P}\\right|_{\\text {Coexistence }}=\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta S}=\\frac{T_{c}\\left(v^{*}-v_{0}\\right)}{L}\n$$\n\nSince eq.(VII.56) gives the gas pressure right up to the transition point,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d P}{d T}\\right|_{\\text {Coexistence }}=\\frac{5}{2} \\frac{P}{T}\n$$\n\nUsing the above equations we find a latent heat,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nL=T_{c} v^{*} \\frac{d P}{d T} &\\left.\\right|_{\\text {Coexistence }} &=\\frac{5}{2} P v^{*}=\\frac{5}{2} \\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\zeta_{5 / 2} k_{B} T_{c}\\left(\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\zeta_{3 / 2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow \\quad L=\\frac{5}{2} \\frac{\\zeta_{5 / 2}}{\\zeta_{3 / 2}} k_{B} T_{c} \\approx 1.28 k_{B} T_{c}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo find the compressibility $\\kappa_{T}=\\partial n /\\left.\\partial P\\right|_{T} / n$, take derivatives of eqs.(VII.35), and take advantage of the identity in eq.(VII.52) to get\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{d P}{d z}=\\frac{g k_{B} T}{\\lambda^{3}} \\frac{1}{z} f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z) \\\\\n\\frac{d n}{d z}=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\frac{1}{z} f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe ratio of these equations leads to\n\n$$\n\\kappa_{T}=\\frac{f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z)}{n k_{B} T f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z)}\n$$\n\nwhich diverges at the transition since $\\lim _{z \\rightarrow 1} f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z) \\rightarrow \\infty$, i.e. the isotherms approach the flat coexistence portion tangentially.\n\nFrom the expression for energy in the grand canonical ensemble,\n\n$$\nE=\\frac{3}{2} P V=\\frac{3}{2} V \\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} k_{B} T f_{5 / 2}^{+}(z) \\propto T^{5 / 2} f_{5 / 2}^{+}(z)\n$$\n\nand using eq.(VII.52), the heat capacity is obtained as\n\n$$\nC_{V, N}=\\left.\\frac{d E}{d T}\\right|_{V, N}=\\frac{3}{2} V \\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} k_{B} T\\left[\\frac{5}{2 T} f_{5 / 2}^{+}(z)+\\left.\\frac{1}{z} f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z) \\frac{d z}{d T}\\right|_{V, N}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe derivative $d z /\\left.d T\\right|_{V, N}$ is found from the condition of fixed particle number, using\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d N}{d T}\\right|_{V}=0=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} V\\left[\\frac{3}{2 T} f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z)+\\left.\\frac{1}{z} f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z) \\frac{d z}{d T}\\right|_{V, N}\\right]\n$$\n\nSubstituting the solution\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{T}{z} \\frac{d z}{d T}\\right|_{V, N}=-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z)}{f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z)}\n$$\n\ninto eq.(VII.64) yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{C_{V}}{V k_{B}}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}}\\left[\\frac{5}{2} f_{5 / 2}^{+}(z)-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{f_{3 / 2}^{+}(z)^{2}}{f_{1 / 2}^{+}(z)}\\right]\n$$\n\nExpanding the result in powers of $z$ indicates that at high temperatures the heat capacity is larger than the classical value; $C_{V} / N k_{B}=3 / 2\\left[1+n \\lambda^{3} / 2^{7 / 2}+\\cdots\\right] .$ At low temperatures, $z=1$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{C_{V}}{N k_{B}}=\\frac{15}{4} \\frac{g}{n \\lambda^{3}} \\zeta_{5 / 2}=\\frac{15}{4} \\frac{\\zeta_{5 / 2}}{\\zeta_{3 / 2}}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{c}}\\right)^{3 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe origin of the $T^{3 / 2}$ behavior at low temperatures is easily understood. At $T=0$ all particles occupy the $\\vec{k}=0$ state. At small but finite temperatures there is occupation of states of finite momentum, up to a value of approximately $k_{m}$ such that $\\hbar^{2} k_{m}^{2} / 2 m=k_{B} T$. Each of these states has an energy proportional to $k_{B} T .$ The excitation energy in $d$ dimensions is thus given by $E_{\\times} \\propto V k_{m}^{d} k_{B} T .$ The resulting heat capacity is $C_{V} \\propto V k_{B} T^{d / 2}$. The reasoning is similar to that used to calculate the heat capacities of a phonon (or photon) gas. The difference in the power laws simply originates from the difference in the energy spectrum of low energy excitations $\\left(\\mathcal{E}(k) \\propto k^{2}\\right.$ in the former and $\\mathcal{E}(k) \\propto k$ for the latter). In both cases the total number of excitations is not conserved, corresponding to $\\mu=0 .$ For the bose gas, this lack of conservation only persists up to the transition temperature, at which point all particles are excited out of the reservoir with $\\mu=0$ at $\\vec{k}=0 . \\quad C_{V}$ is continuous at $T_{c}$, reaching a maximum value of approximately $1.92 k_{B}$ per particle, but has a discontinuous derivative at this point.

It changes sign at a temperature proportional to $\\mathcal{E}_{F} / k_{B}$.\n\nThe low temperature expansion for the pressure is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta P &=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} f_{5 / 2}^{-}(z)=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\frac{(\\ln z)^{5 / 2}}{(5 / 2) !}\\left[1+\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{6} \\frac{5}{2} \\frac{3}{2}(\\ln z)^{-2}+\\cdots\\right] \\\\\n&=\\frac{g}{\\lambda^{3}} \\frac{8\\left(\\beta \\mathcal{E}_{F}\\right)^{5 / 2}}{15 \\sqrt{\\pi}}\\left[1-\\frac{5}{2} \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{12}\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mathcal{E}_{F}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right]\\left[1+\\frac{5 \\pi^{2}}{8}\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mathcal{E}_{F}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right] \\\\\n&=P_{F}\\left[1+\\frac{5}{12} \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mathcal{E}_{F}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{F}=(2 / 5) n \\mathcal{E}_{F}$ if the fermi pressure. Unlike its classical counterpart, the fermi gas at zero temperature has finite pressure and internal energy.\n\nThe low temperature expansion for the internal energy is obtained easily from eq.(VII.47) using\n\n$$\n\\frac{E}{V}=\\frac{3}{2} P=\\frac{3}{5} n k_{B} T_{F}\\left[1+\\frac{5}{12} \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{F}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere we have introduced the fermi temperature $T_{F}=\\mathcal{E}_{F} / k_{B} .$ Eq.(VII.48) leads to a low temperature heat capacity,\n\n$$\nC_{V}=\\frac{d E}{d T}=\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{2} N k_{B}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{F}}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{F}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nThe linear vanishing of the heat capacity as $T \\rightarrow 0$ is a general feature of a fermi gas, valid in all dimensions. It has the following simple physical interpretation: The probability of occupying single-particle states, eq.(VII.40), is very close to a step function at small temperatures. Only particles within a distance of approximately $k_{B} T$ of the fermi energy can be thermally excited. This represents only a small fraction $T / T_{F}$, of the total number of electrons. Each excited particle gains an energy of the order of $k_{B} T$, leading to a change in the internal energy of approximately $k_{B} T N\\left(T / T_{F}\\right) .$ Hence the heat capacity is given by $C_{V}=d E / d T \\sim N k_{B} T / T_{F}$. This conclusion is also valid for an interacting fermi gas. The fact that only a small number, $N\\left(T / T_{F}\\right)$, of fermions are excited at small temperatures accounts for many interesting properties of fermi gases. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of a classical gas of $N$ non-interacting particles of magnetic moment $\\mu_{B}$ follows the Curie law, $\\chi \\propto N \\mu_{B}^{2} /\\left(k_{B} T\\right)$. Since quantum mechanically, only a fraction of spins contributes at low temperatures, the low temperature susceptibility saturates to a (Pauli) value of $\\chi \\propto N \\mu_{B}^{2} /\\left(k_{B} T_{F}\\right)$.

In both the bosonic and fermionic subspaces, the set of occupation numbers $\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}}\\right\\}$ uniquely identify a state. We can, however, remove this restriction from eq.(VII.11), if we divide by the resulting over-counting factor (for bosons) of $N ! /\\left(\\prod_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}} !\\right)$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\{\\vec{k}\\}}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{\\{\\vec{k}\\}} \\frac{\\prod_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}} !}{N !}\n$$\n\n(Note that for fermions, the $(-1)^{P}$ factors cancel out the contributions from cases where any $n_{\\vec{k}}$ is larger than one.)

The classical result $Z_{N}=\\left(V / \\lambda^{3}\\right)^{N} / N !$, is obtained from the term corresponding to no particle exchange, $Q \\equiv 1 .$ The division by $N !$ finally justifies the factor that was (somewhat artificially) introduces in classical statistical mechanics to deal with the phase space of identical particles. However, this classical result is only valid at very high temperature and is modified by the quantum corrections coming from the remaining permutations. As any permutation involves a product of factors $\\exp \\left[-\\pi\\left(\\vec{x}_{1}-\\vec{x}_{2}\\right)^{2} / \\lambda^{2}\\right]$, its contributions vanishes as $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ for $T \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\nThe lowest order correction comes from the simplest permutation which is the exchange of two particles. The exchange of particles 1 and 2 is accompanied by a factor of $\\eta \\exp \\left[-2 \\pi\\left(\\vec{x}_{1}-\\vec{x}_{2}\\right)^{2} / \\lambda^{2}\\right] .$ As each of the possible $N(N-1) / 2$ pairwise exchanges gives the same contribution to $Z_{N}$, we get\n\n$$\nZ_{N}=\\frac{1}{N ! \\lambda^{3 N}} \\int \\prod_{\\alpha=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{x}_{\\alpha}\\left\\{1+\\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\eta \\exp \\left[-\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda^{2}}\\left(\\vec{x}_{1}-\\vec{x}_{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]+\\cdots\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFor any $\\alpha \\geq 2, \\int d^{3} \\vec{x}_{\\alpha}=V ;$ in the remaining two integrations we can use the relative, $\\vec{r}_{12}=\\vec{x}_{2}-\\vec{x}_{1}$, and center of mass coordinates to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nZ_{N} &=\\frac{1}{N ! \\lambda^{3 N}} V^{N}\\left[1+\\frac{N(N-1)}{2 V} \\eta \\int d^{3} \\vec{r}_{12} e^{-2 \\pi \\vec{r}_{12}^{2} / \\lambda^{2}}+\\cdots\\right] \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{N !}\\left(\\frac{V}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{N}\\left[1+\\frac{N(N-1)}{2 V} \\cdot\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi \\lambda^{2}}{4 \\pi}}\\right)^{3} \\eta+\\cdots\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the corresponding free energy,\n\n$$\nF=-k_{B} T \\ln Z_{N}=-N k_{B} T \\ln \\left[\\frac{e}{\\lambda^{3}} \\cdot \\frac{V}{N}\\right]-\\frac{k_{B} T N^{2}}{2 V} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{2^{3 / 2}} \\eta+\\cdots\n$$\n\nthe gas pressure is computed as\n\n$$\nP=-\\left.\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right|_{T}=\\frac{N k_{B} T}{V}-\\frac{N^{2} k_{B} T}{V^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{2^{5 / 2}} \\eta+\\cdots=n k_{B} T\\left[1-\\frac{\\eta \\lambda^{3}}{2^{5 / 2}} n+\\cdots\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the first quantum correction is equivalent to a second virial coefficient of\n\n$$\nB_{2}=-\\frac{\\eta \\lambda^{3}}{2^{5 / 2}}\n$$\n\nThe resulting correction to pressure is negative for bosons, and positive for fermions. In the classical formulation, a second virial coefficient was obtained from a two-body interaction. The classical potential $\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{r})$ that leads to the second virial coefficient in eq.(VII.22) is obtained from\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&f(\\vec{r})=e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{r})}-1=\\eta e^{-2 \\pi \\vec{r}^{2} / \\lambda^{2}}, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\\\\n&\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{r})=-k_{B} T \\ln \\left[1+\\eta e^{-2 \\pi \\vec{r}^{2} / \\lambda^{2}}\\right] \\approx-k_{B} T \\eta e^{-2 \\pi \\vec{r}^{2} / \\lambda^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(The final approximation corresponds to high temperatures, where only the first correction is important). Thus the effects of quantum statistics at high temperatures are approximately equivalent to introducing an interaction between particles. The interaction is attractive for bosons, repulsive for fermions, and operates over distances of the order of the thermal wavelength $\\lambda$. \n\n\\section{VII.C Grand Canonical Formulation}\n\nCalculating the partition function by performing all the sums in eq.(VII.17) is a formidable task. Alternatively, we can compute $Z_{N}$ in the energy basis as\n\n$$\nZ_{N}=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}\\right)=\\sum_{\\left\\{\\vec{k}_{\\alpha}\\right\\}}^{\\prime} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N} \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\vec{k}_{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]=\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}}\\right\\}}^{\\prime} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{\\vec{k}} \\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k}) n(\\vec{k})\\right]\n$$\n\nThese sums are still difficult to perform due to the restrictions of symmetry on the allowed values of $\\vec{k}$ or $\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}}\\right\\}:$ The occupation numbers $\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}}\\right\\}$ are restricted to $\\sum_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}}=N$, and $n_{\\vec{k}}=0,1,2, \\cdots$ for bosons, while $n_{\\vec{k}}=0$ or 1 for fermions.

This difficulty was overcome by postulating that the phase space for $N$ identical particles must be divided by $N !$, the number of permutations. This is not quite satisfactory as the classical equations of motion implicitly treat the particles as distinct. In quantum mechanics, by contrast, the identity of particles appears at the level of allowed states in Hilbert space. For example, the probability of finding two identical particles at positions $\\vec{x}_{1}$ and $\\vec{x}_{2}$ is $\\left|\\Psi\\left(\\vec{x}_{1}, \\vec{x}_{2}\\right)\\right|^{2} .$ Since the exchange of particles 1 and 2 leads to the same configurations, we must have $\\left|\\Psi\\left(\\vec{x}_{1}, \\vec{x}_{2}\\right)\\right|^{2}=\\left|\\Psi\\left(\\vec{x}_{2}, \\vec{x}_{1}\\right)\\right|^{2}$. For a single-valued function, this leads to two possibilities:\n\n$$\n|\\psi(1,2)\\rangle=+|\\psi(2,1)\\rangle, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad|\\psi(1,2)\\rangle=-|\\psi(2,1)\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe Hilbert space used to describe identical particles is thus restricted to obey certain symmetries.\n\nFor a system of $N$ identical particles, there are $N !$ permutations $P$, forming a group $S_{N} .$ There are several ways for representing a permutation; e.g., $P(1234)=(3241)$ for $N=4$ can alternatively be indicated by\n\n$$\nP=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 4 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nAny permutation can be obtained from a sequence of two particle exchanges. For example, the above permutation is obtained by the exchanges $(1,3)$ and $(1,4)$ performed in sequence. The parity of a permutation is defined as\n\n$$\n(-1)^{P} \\equiv \\begin{cases}+1 & \\text { if } P \\text { involves to an even number of exchanges, e.g. }(123) \\rightarrow(231) \\\\ -1 & \\text { if } P \\text { involves an odd number of exchanges, e.g. }(123) \\rightarrow(213)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n(Note that if lines are drawn connecting the initial an final locations of each integer in eq.(VII.2), the parity is $(-1)$ raised to the number of intersections of these lines.)\n\nThe action of permutations on an $N$ -particle quantum state leads to a representation of the permutation group in Hilbert space.

This allows for two types of identical particles in nature:\n\n(1) Bosons correspond to the fully symmetric representation such that\n\n$$\nP|\\psi(1, \\cdots, N)\\rangle=+|\\psi(1, \\cdots, N)\\rangle\n$$\n\n(2) Fermions correspond to the fully anti-symmetric representation such that\n\n$$\nP|\\psi(1, \\cdots, N)\\rangle=(-1)^{P}|\\psi(1, \\cdots, N)\\rangle\n$$\n\nOf course, the Hamiltonian for identical particles must itself be symmetric, i.e. $P \\mathcal{H}=$ $\\mathcal{H}$. However, for a given $\\mathcal{H}$, there are many eigen-states with different symmetries under permutations. To select the correct set of eigen-states, in quantum mechanics the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions) is specified independently. For example, consider $N$ non-interacting particles in a box of volume $V$, with a Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}=\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N} \\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}=\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N}\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \\nabla_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nEach $\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}$ can be separately diagonalized, with plane wave states $\\{|\\vec{k}\\rangle\\}$ and corresponding energies $\\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k})=\\hbar^{2} k^{2} / 2 m .$ Using sums and products of these one-particle states, we can construct the following $-N$ particle states:\n\n(1) The product Hilbert space is obtained by simple multiplication of the one-body states, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes} \\equiv\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}\\right\\rangle \\cdots\\left|\\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIn the coordinate representation,\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\vec{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{x}_{N} \\mid \\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes}=\\frac{1}{V^{N / 2}} \\exp \\left(i \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N} \\vec{k}_{\\alpha} \\cdot \\vec{x}_{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes}=\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N} \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} k_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right)\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes}\n$$\n\nBut the product states do not satisfy the symmetry requirements for identical particles, and we must find the appropriate subspaces of correct symmetry. (2) The fermionic subspace is constructed as\n\n$$\n\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{-}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{-}}} \\sum_{P}(-1)^{P} P\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes}\n$$\n\nwhere the sum is over all $N !$ permutations. Clearly, if any one-particle label $\\vec{k}$, appears more than once in the above list, the result is zero and there is no anti-symmetrized state. Anti-symmetrization is possible only when all the $N$ values of $\\vec{k}_{\\alpha}$ are different. In this case, there are $N !$ terms in the above sum, and $N_{-}=N !$ is necessary to ensure normalization. For example, a two-particle anti-symmetrized state is\n\n$$\n\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\vec{k}_{2}\\right\\rangle_{-}=\\frac{\\left(\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\vec{k}_{2}\\right\\rangle-\\left|\\vec{k}_{2}, \\vec{k}_{1}\\right\\rangle\\right)}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\n(If not otherwise indicated, $\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle$ refers to the product state.)\n\n(3) Similarly, the bosonic subspace is constructed as\n\n$$\n\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{+}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{+}}} \\sum_{P} P\\left|\\vec{k}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{k}_{N}\\right\\rangle_{\\otimes}\n$$\n\nIn this case, there are no restrictions on the allowed values of $\\vec{k}$. A particular oneparticle state may be repeated $n_{\\vec{k}}$ times in the list, with $\\sum_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}}=N .$ As we shall prove shortly, proper normalization requires $N_{+}=N ! \\prod_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}} ! . \\quad$ For example, a correctly normalized 3-particle bosonic state is constructed from two one-particle states $|\\alpha\\rangle$, and one one- particle state $|\\beta\\rangle$ as $\\left(n_{\\alpha}=2, n_{\\beta}=1\\right.$, and $\\left.N_{+}=3 ! 2 ! 1 !=12\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|\\alpha \\alpha \\beta\\rangle_{+} &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}}(|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle+|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle+|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle+|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle+|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle+|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle+|\\alpha\\rangle|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle+|\\beta\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- It is convenient to discuss bosons and fermions simultaneously by defining\n\n$$\n|\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle_{\\eta}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{\\eta}}} \\sum_{P} \\eta^{P} P|\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle, \\text { with } \\eta= \\begin{cases}+1 & \\text { for bosons } \\\\ -1 & \\text { for fermions }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nEach state is uniquely specified by a set of occupation numbers $\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}}\\right\\}$, such that $\\sum_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}}=N$, and\n\n(1) For fermions, $|\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle_{-}=0$, unless $n_{\\vec{k}}=0$ or 1, and $N_{-}=N ! \\prod_{k} n_{\\vec{k}} !=N !$\n\n(2) For bosons, any $\\vec{k}$ may be repeated $n_{\\vec{k}}$ times, and the normalization is calculated from\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n+\\langle\\{\\vec{k}\\} \\mid\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle_{+} &=\\frac{1}{N_{+}} \\sum_{P, P^{\\prime}}\\left\\langle P\\{\\vec{k}\\} \\mid P^{\\prime}\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{N !}{N_{+}} \\sum_{P}\\langle\\{\\vec{k}\\} \\mid P\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle \\\\\n&=\\frac{N ! \\prod_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}} !}{N_{+}}=1, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N_{+}=N ! \\prod_{k} n_{\\vec{k}} !\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(The $\\operatorname{term}\\langle\\{\\vec{k}\\} \\mid P\\{\\vec{k}\\}\\rangle$ is zero unless the permuted $\\vec{k}$ 's are identical to the original set, which happens $\\prod_{\\vec{k}} n_{\\vec{k}} !$ times. $)$\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lec21","n":1},"1":{"v":"\\section{VI.D Quantum microstates}\n\nIn the previous sections we indicated several failures of classical statistical mechanics, which were heuristically remedied by assuming quantized energy levels, while still calculating thermodynamic quantities from a partition sum $Z=\\sum_{n} \\exp \\left(-\\beta E_{n}\\right)$. This implicitly assumes that the micro-states of a quantum system are specified by its discretized energy levels, and governed by a probability distribution similar to a Boltzmann weight. This 'analogy' to classical statistical mechanics needs to be justified. Furthermore, quantum mechanics is itself inherently probabilistic, with uncertainties unrelated to those that lead to probabilities in statistical mechanics. Here, we shall construct a quantum formulation of statistical mechanics by closely following the steps that lead to the classical formulation.\n\nMicro-states of a classical system of particles are described by the set of coordinates and conjugate momenta $\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\} ;$ i.e. by a point in the $6 N$ -dimensional phase space. In quantum mechanics $\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}\\right\\}$ are not independent observables. Instead:\n\n- The (micro-) state of a quantum system is completely specified by a unit vector $|\\Psi\\rangle$, which belongs to an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The vector $|\\Psi\\rangle$ can be written in terms of its components $\\langle n \\mid \\Psi\\rangle$, which are complex numbers, along a suitable set of ortho-normal basis vectors $|n\\rangle .$ In the convenient notation introduced by Dirac, this decomposition is written as\n\n$$\n|\\Psi\\rangle=\\sum_{n}\\langle n \\mid \\Psi\\rangle|n\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe most familiar basis is that of coordinates $\\left|\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}\\right\\rangle$, and $\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\} \\mid \\Psi\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\Psi\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}, \\ldots, \\vec{q}_{N}\\right)$ is the wave-function.

In quantum mechanics, these functions are replaced by Hermitian matrices (operators) in Hilbert space, obtained by substituting operators for $\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}\\right\\}$ in the classical expression (after proper symmetrization of products, e.g. $p q \\rightarrow(p q+q p) / 2)$.

When we no longer have exact knowledge of the microstate, it is said to be in a mixed state.\n\nClassically, ensemble averages are calculated from\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}\\right)_{t}}=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha} \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\mu_{\\alpha}(t)\\right)=\\int \\prod_{i=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i} d^{3} \\overrightarrow{q_{i}} \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}\\right) \\rho\\left(\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}, t\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}, t\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha} \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{i}(t)_{\\alpha}\\right) \\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{p}_{i}-\\vec{p}_{i}(t)_{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nis the ensemble density.\n\nSimilarly, a mixed quantum state is obtained from a set of possible states $\\left\\{\\left|\\psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$, with probabilities $\\left\\{p_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$. The ensemble average of the quantum mechanical expectation value in eq.(VI.67) is then given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overline{\\langle\\mathcal{O}\\rangle} &=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha}|\\mathcal{O}| \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha, m, n} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha} \\mid m\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\langle m|\\mathcal{O}| n\\rangle \\\\\n&=\\sum_{m, n}\\langle n|\\rho| m\\rangle\\langle m|\\mathcal{O}| n\\rangle=\\operatorname{tr}(\\rho \\mathcal{O})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we have introduced a basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$, and defined the density matrix\n\n$$\n\\langle n|\\rho(t)| m\\rangle \\equiv \\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}(t)\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha}(t) \\mid m\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nClassically, the probability (density) $\\rho(t)$ is a function defined on phase space. As all operators in phase space, it is replaced by a matrix in quantum mechanics. Stripped of the choice of basis, the density matrix is\n\n$$\n\\rho(t)=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left|\\Psi_{\\alpha}(t)\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha}(t)\\right|\n$$\n\nClearly, $\\rho$ corresponds to a pure state if and only if $\\rho^{2}=\\rho$\n\nThe density matrix satisfies the following properties:\n\n(i) Normalization: Since each $\\left|\\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle$ is normalized to unity,\n\n$$\n\\langle 1\\rangle=\\operatorname{tr}(\\rho)=\\sum_{n}\\langle n|\\rho| n\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha, n} p_{\\alpha}\\left|\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\right|^{2}=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}=1\n$$\n\n(ii) Hermiticity: The density matrix is Hermitian, i.e. $\\rho^{\\dagger}=\\rho$, since\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle m\\left|\\rho^{\\dagger}\\right| n\\right\\rangle=\\langle n|\\rho| m\\rangle^{*}=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha} \\mid m\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle=\\langle n|\\rho| m\\rangle\n$$\n\nensuring that the averages in eq.(VI.76) are real numbers.\n\n(iii) Positivity: For any $|\\Phi\\rangle$,\n\n$$\n\\langle\\Phi|\\rho| \\Phi\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle\\Phi \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha} \\mid \\Phi\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left|\\left\\langle\\Phi \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\right|^{2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nThus $\\rho$ is positive definite, implying that all its eigenvalues must be positive.\n\n- Liouville's theorem governs the time evolution of the classical density as\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\rho}{d t}=\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}-\\{\\mathcal{H}, \\rho\\}=0\n$$\n\nIt is most convenient to examine the evolution of the quantum density matrix in the basis of energy eigen-states, where according to eq.(VI.70)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\langle n|\\rho(t)| m\\rangle &=i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}(t)\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha}(t) \\mid m\\right\\rangle \\\\\n&=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left[\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{n}-\\mathcal{E}_{m}\\right)\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha} \\mid m\\right\\rangle\\right] \\\\\n&=\\langle n|(\\mathcal{H} \\rho-\\rho \\mathcal{H})| m\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe final result is a tensorial identity, and hence, independent of the choice of basis\n\n$$\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rho=[\\mathcal{H}, \\rho]\n$$\n\nEquilibrium requires time independent averages, and suggests $\\partial \\rho / \\partial t=0 .$ This condition is satisfied in both eqs.(VI.81) and (VI.83) by choosing $\\rho=\\rho(\\mathcal{H}) .$ (As discussed in chapter III, $\\rho$ may also depend on conserved quantities such that $[\\mathcal{H}, L]=0 .)$ Various equilibrium quantum density matrices can now be constructed in analogy to classical statistical mechanics.\n\n- Microcanonical ensemble: As the internal energy has a fixed value $E$, a density matrix that includes this constraint is\n\n$$\n\\rho(E)=\\frac{\\delta(\\mathcal{H}-E)}{\\Omega(E)}\n$$\n\nIn particular, in the basis of energy eigen-states,\n\n$$\n\\langle n|\\rho| m\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha} p_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle n \\mid \\Psi_{\\alpha}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_{\\alpha} \\mid m\\right\\rangle= \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{\\Omega} & \\text { if } \\mathcal{E}_{n}=E, \\text { and } m=n \\\\ 0 & \\text { if } \\mathcal{E}_{n} \\neq E, \\text { or } m \\neq n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe first condition states that only eigen-states of the correct energy can appear in the quantum wave-function, and that (for $\\left.p_{\\alpha}=1 / \\mathcal{N}\\right)$ such states on average have the same amplitude, $\\overline{\\left.\\langle n \\mid \\Psi\\rangle\\right|^{2}}=1 / \\Omega .$ This is equivalent to the classical postulate of equal a priori equilibrium probabilities. The second (additional) condition states that the $\\Omega$ eigen-states of energy $E$ are combined in a typical micro-state with independent random phases. (Note that the normalization condition $\\operatorname{tr} \\rho=1$, implies that $\\Omega(E)=\\sum_{n} \\delta\\left(E-E_{n}\\right)$ is the number of eigen-states of $\\mathcal{H}$ with energy $E .)$\n\n- Canonical ensemble: A fixed temperature $T=1 / k_{B} \\beta$, can be achieved by putting the system in contact with a reservoir. By considering the combined system, the canonical density matrix is obtained as\n\n$$\n\\rho(\\beta)=\\frac{\\exp (-\\beta \\mathcal{H})}{Z(\\beta)}\n$$\n\nThe normalization condition $\\operatorname{tr}(\\rho)=1$, leads to the quantum partition function\n\n$$\nZ=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}\\right)=\\sum_{n} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{E}_{n}}\n$$\n\nThe final sum is over the (discrete) energy levels of $\\mathcal{H}$, and justifies the calculations performed in the previous sections.\n\n- Grand Canonical Ensemble: The number of particles $N$, is no longer fixed. Quantum micro-states with indefinite particle number span a so called Fock space. The density matrix is\n\n$$\n\\rho(\\beta, \\mu)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}+\\beta \\mu N}}{\\mathcal{Q}}, \\quad \\text { where } \\quad \\mathcal{Q}(\\beta, \\mu)=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}+\\beta \\mu N}\\right)=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z_{N}(\\beta)\n$$\n\nExample: Consider a single particle in a quantum canonical ensemble in a box of volume $V$. The energy eigen-states of the Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{1}=\\frac{\\vec{p}^{2}}{2 m}=-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \\nabla^{2}, \\quad \\text { (in coordinate basis) }\n$$\n\nobtained from $\\mathcal{H}_{1}|\\vec{k}\\rangle=\\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k})|\\vec{k}\\rangle$, are\n\n$$\n\\langle\\vec{x} \\mid \\vec{k}\\rangle=\\frac{e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{x}}}{\\sqrt{V}}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k})=\\frac{\\hbar^{2} k^{2}}{2 m}\n$$\n\nWith periodic boundary conditions in a box of size $L$, the allowed values of $\\vec{k}$ are $(2 \\pi / L)\\left(\\ell_{x}, \\ell_{y}, \\ell_{z}\\right)$, where $\\left(\\ell_{x}, \\ell_{y}, \\ell_{z}\\right)$ are integers. A particular vector in this one-particle Hilbert space is specified by its components along each of these basis states (infinite in number). The space of quantum micro-states is thus much larger than the corresponding 6-dimensional classical phase space.

Elements of the density matrix in a coordinate representation are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\langle\\vec{x}^{\\prime}|\\rho| \\vec{x}\\right\\rangle &=\\sum_{\\vec{k}}\\left\\langle\\vec{x}^{\\prime} \\mid \\vec{k}\\right\\rangle \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{E}(\\vec{k})}}{Z_{1}}\\langle\\vec{k} \\mid \\vec{x}\\rangle=\\frac{\\lambda^{3}}{V} \\int \\frac{V d^{3} \\vec{k}}{(2 \\pi)^{3}} \\frac{e^{-i \\vec{k} \\cdot\\left(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}^{\\prime}\\right)}}{V} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\beta \\hbar^{2} k^{2}}{2 m}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{V} \\exp \\left[-\\frac{m\\left(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}}{2 \\beta \\hbar^{2}}\\right]=\\frac{1}{V} \\exp \\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\left(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}}{\\lambda^{2}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe diagonal elements, $\\langle\\vec{x}|\\rho| \\vec{x}\\rangle=1 / V$, are just the probabilities for finding a particle at $\\vec{x}$. The off-diagonal elements have no classical analog. They suggest that the appropriate way to think of the particle is as a wave-packet of size $\\lambda=h / \\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_{B} T}$, the thermal wavelength. As $T \\rightarrow \\infty, \\lambda$ goes to zero, and the classical analysis is valid. As $T \\rightarrow 0$, $\\lambda$ diverges and quantum mechanical effects take over when $\\lambda$ becomes comparable to the size of the box.\n\nAlternatively, we could have obtained eq.(VI.92), by noting that eq.(VI.86) implies\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} Z \\rho=-\\mathcal{H} Z \\rho=\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \\nabla^{2} Z \\rho\n$$\n\nThis is just the diffusion equation (for the free particle), which can be solved subject to the initial condition $\\rho(\\beta=0)=1$ (i.e. $\\left.\\left\\langle\\vec{x}^{\\prime}|\\rho(\\beta=0)| \\vec{x}\\right\\rangle=\\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}^{\\prime}\\right) / V\\right)$ to yield the result of eq.(VI.92).

The need to include quantum mechanical effects becomes specially apparent at low temperatures. In this section we shall first demonstrate the failure of the classical results in the contexts of heat capacities of molecular gases and solids, and the ultra-violet catastrophe in black body radiation. We shall then reformulate statistical mechanics using quantum concepts.\n\n\\section{VI.A Dilute Polyatomic Gases}\n\nConsider a dilute gas of polyatomic molecules. The Hamiltonian for each molecule of $n$ atoms is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\vec{p}_{i}^{2}}{2 m}+\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}, \\ldots, \\vec{q}_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the potential energy $\\mathcal{V}$, contains all the information on molecular bonds. For simplicity, we have assumed that all atoms in the molecule have the same mass. If the masses are different, the Hamiltonian can be brought into the above form by rescaling the coordinates $\\vec{q}_{i}$ by $\\sqrt{m_{i} / m}$ (and the momenta by $\\left.\\sqrt{m / m_{i}}\\right)$, where $m_{i}$ is the mass of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ atom. Ignoring the interactions between molecules, the partition function of a dilute gas is\n\n$$\nZ(N)=\\frac{Z_{1}^{N}}{N !}=\\frac{1}{N !}\\left\\{\\int \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i}}{h^{3}} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\vec{p}_{i}^{2}}{2 m}-\\beta \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}, \\ldots, \\vec{q}_{n}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}^{N}\n$$\n\nThe chemical bonds that keep the molecule together are usually quite strong (energies of the order of electron volts). At typical accessible temperatures, which are much smaller than the corresponding dissociation temperatures $\\left(\\approx 10^{4 \\circ} \\mathrm{K}\\right)$, the molecule has a well defined shape and only undergoes small deformations. The contribution of these deformations to the one particle partition function $Z_{1}$, can be computed as follows:\n\n(a) The first step is to find the equilibrium positions, $\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, \\vec{q}_{n}^{*}\\right)$, by minimizing the potential $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\n(b) The energy cost of small deformations about equilibrium is then obtained by setting $\\vec{q}_{i}=\\vec{q}_{i}^{*}+\\vec{u}_{i}$, and making an expansion in powers of $\\vec{u}$\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^{n} \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial q_{i, \\alpha} \\partial q_{j, \\beta}} u_{i, \\alpha} u_{j, \\beta}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(u^{3}\\right)\n$$\n\n(Here $i, j=1, \\cdots, n$, identify the atoms, and $\\alpha, \\beta=1,2,3$ label a particular component.) Since the expansion is around a stable equilibrium configuration, the first derivatives are absent in eq.(VI.3), and the matrix of second derivatives is positive definite, i.e. it has only non-negative eigenvalues.\n\n(c) The normal modes of the molecule are obtained by diagonalizing the $3 n \\times 3 n$ matrix $\\partial^{2} \\mathcal{V} / \\partial q_{i, \\alpha} \\partial q_{j, \\beta} .$ The resulting $3 n$ eigenvalues $K_{s}$, indicate the stiffness of each mode. We can change variables from the original deformations $\\left\\{\\vec{u}_{i}\\right\\}$, to the amplitudes $\\left\\{\\tilde{u}_{s}\\right\\}$, of the eigenmodes. The corresponding conjugate momenta are $\\tilde{p}_{s}=m \\dot{\\tilde{u}}_{s} .$ Since the transformation from $\\left\\{\\vec{u}_{i}\\right\\}$ to $\\left\\{\\tilde{u}_{s}\\right\\}$ is unitary (preserving the length of a vector), $\\sum_{i} \\vec{p}_{i}{ }^{2}=\\sum_{s} \\tilde{p}_{s}^{2}$, and the quadratic part of the resulting deformation Hamiltonian is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{1}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\sum_{s=1}^{3 n}\\left[\\frac{1}{2 m} \\tilde{p}_{s}^{2}+\\frac{K_{s}}{2} \\tilde{u}_{s}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\n(Such transformations are also canonical, preserving the measure of integration in phase space, $\\left.\\prod_{i, \\alpha} d u_{i, \\alpha} d p_{i, \\alpha}=\\prod_{s} d \\tilde{u}_{s} d \\tilde{p}_{s} .\\right)$\n\nThe average energy of each molecule is the expectation value of the above Hamiltonian. Since each quadratic degree of freedom classically contributes a factor of $k_{B} T / 2$ to the energy,\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\right\\rangle=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{3 n+m}{2} k_{B} T\n$$\n\nOnly modes with a finite stiffness can store potential energy, and $m$ is defined as the number such modes with non-zero $K_{s} .$ The following symmetries of the potential force some eigenvalues to zero:\n\n(a) Translation symmetry: Since $\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\overrightarrow{q_{1}}+\\vec{c}, \\cdots, \\vec{q}_{n}+\\vec{c}\\right)=\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{q}_{n}\\right)$, no energy is stored the center of mass coordinate $\\vec{Q}=\\sum_{\\alpha} \\vec{q}_{\\alpha} / n$, i.e. $\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{Q})=\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{Q}+\\vec{c})$, and the corresponding three values of $K_{\\text {trans }}$ are zero.\n\n(b) Rotation symmetry: There is also no potential energy associated with rotations of the molecule, and $K_{\\mathrm{rot}}=0$ for the corresponding stiffnesses. The number of rotational modes, $0 \\leq r \\leq 3$, depends on the shape of the molecule; for example, a rod shaped molecule has $r=2$, as a rotation parallel to its axis does not result in a new configuration.\n\nThe remaining $m=3 n-3-r$ eigenvectors of the matrix have non-zero stiffness, and correspond to the vibrational normal modes. The energy per molecule, from eq.(VI.5), is thus\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{6 n-3-r}{2} k_{B} T\n$$\n\nThe corresponding heat capacities,\n\n$$\nC_{V}=\\frac{(6 n-3-r)}{2} k_{B}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad C_{P}=C_{V}+k_{B}=\\frac{(6 n-1-r)}{2} k_{B}\n$$\n\nare temperature independent. The ratio $\\gamma=C_{P} / C_{V}$ is easily measured in adiabatic processes. Values of $\\gamma$, expected on the basis of the above argument, are listed below for a number of different molecules.\n\nMonatomic\n\n$\\theta(n)$\n\nDiatomic\n\nTetra-atomic\n\n$0.5$\n\n$\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$\n\n$$\nn=4\n$$\n\n$$\nr=3 \\quad \\gamma=20 / 18=10 / 9\n$$\n\nMeasurements of the heat capacity of dilute gases do not agree with the above predictions. For example, the value $C_{V} / k_{B}=7 / 2$, for a diatomic gas such as oxygen, is only observed at temperatures higher than a few thousand degrees Kelvin. At room temperatures, a lower value of $5 / 2$ is observed, while at even lower temperatures of around $10^{0} K$, it is further reduced to $3 / 2 .$ The low temperature value is similar to that of a monatomic gas, and suggests that no energy is stored in the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. These observations can be explained if the allowed energy levels are quantized.\n\n- Vibrational modes: A diatomic molecule has one vibrational mode with stiffness $K \\equiv m \\omega^{2}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency of oscillations. The classical partition function for this mode is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nZ_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{c} &=\\int \\frac{d p d q}{h} \\exp \\left[-\\beta\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2 m}+\\frac{m \\omega^{2} q^{2}}{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{h} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m}{\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\beta m \\omega^{2}}\\right)}=\\frac{2 \\pi}{h \\beta \\omega}=\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar \\omega}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The corresponding energy stored in this mode,\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{vib}}\\right\\rangle^{c}=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}=\\frac{\\partial \\ln (\\beta \\hbar \\omega)}{\\partial \\beta}=\\frac{1}{\\beta}=k_{B} T\n$$\n\ncomes from $k_{B} T / 2$ per kinetic and potential degrees of freedom. In quantum mechanics, the allowed values of energy are quantized such that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}=\\hbar \\omega\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $n=0,1,2, \\cdots$. Assuming that the probability of each discrete level is proportional to its Boltzmann weight (as will be justified later on), there is a normalization factor\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega(n+1 / 2)}=\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega / 2}}{1-e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}}\n$$\n\nThe high temperature limit,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\beta \\rightarrow 0} Z_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}=\\frac{1}{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}=\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar \\omega}\n$$\n\ncoincides with eq.(VI.8)(due in part to the choice of $h$ as the measure of classical phase space).\n\nThe expectation value of vibrational energy is\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}=\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln \\left(1-e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}\\right)=\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}+\\hbar \\omega \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}}{1-e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}}\n$$\n\nThe first term is the energy cost of quantum fluctuations that are present even in the zero temperature ground state. The second term describes the additional energy due to thermal fluctuations. The resulting heat capacity,\n\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}=\\frac{d E_{\\mathrm{vib}}^{q}}{d T}=k_{B}\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{k_{B} T}\\right)^{2} \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}}{\\left(1-e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nachieves the classical value of $k_{B}$ only at temperatures $T \\gg \\theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, where $\\theta_{\\mathrm{vib}}=\\hbar \\omega / k_{B}$ is a characteristic temperature associated with the quanta of vibrational energy. For $T \\ll \\theta_{\\text {vib }}$, $C_{\\text {vib }}^{q}$ goes to zero as $\\exp \\left(-\\theta_{\\text {vib }} / T\\right)$. Typical values of $\\theta_{\\text {vib }}$ are in the range of $10^{3}$ to $10^{4}$ degrees Kelvin, explaining why the classical value of heat capacity is observed only at higher temperatures.\n\n- Rotational modes: To account for the low temperature anomaly in the heat capacity of diatomic molecules, we have to study the quantization of the rotational degrees of freedom. Classically, the orientation of a diatomic molecule is specified by two angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, and its Lagrangian (equal to the kinetic energy) is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\frac{I}{2}\\left(\\dot{\\theta}^{2}+\\sin ^{2} \\theta \\dot{\\phi}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia. In terms of the conjugate momenta,\n\n$$\np_{\\theta}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{d \\dot{\\theta}}=I \\dot{\\theta}, \\quad p_{\\phi}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{d \\dot{\\phi}}=I \\sin ^{2} \\theta \\dot{\\phi}\n$$\n\nthe Hamiltonian for rotations is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{rot}}=\\frac{1}{2 I}\\left(p_{\\theta}^{2}+\\frac{p_{\\phi}^{2}}{\\sin ^{2} \\theta}\\right) \\equiv \\frac{\\vec{L}^{2}}{2 I}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{L}$ is the angular momentum.

At very low temperatures, the only contributions come from the kinetic energy of the center of mass, and the molecule behaves as a monatomic particle. (The heat capacity vanishes at even lower temperatures due to quantum statistics, as will be discussed in the context of identical particles.)\n\n\\section{VI.B Vibrations of a Solid}\n\nAttractive interactions between particles first lead to condensation from a gas to liquid at low temperatures, and finally cause freezing into a solid state at even lower temperatures. For the purpose of discussing its thermodynamics, the solid can be regarded as a very large molecule subject to a Hamiltonian similar to eq.(VI.1), with $n=N \\gg 1$ atoms. We can then proceed with the steps outlined in the previous section.\n\n(a) The classical ground state configuration of the solid is obtained by minimizing the potential $\\mathcal{V}$. In almost all cases, the minimum energy corresponds to a periodic arrangement of atoms forming a lattice. In terms of the three basis vectors, $\\hat{a}, \\hat{b}$, and $\\hat{c}$, the locations of atoms in a simple crystal are given by\n\n$$\n\\vec{q}^{*}(\\ell, m, n)=[\\ell \\hat{a}+m \\hat{b}+n \\hat{c}] \\equiv \\vec{r}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\{\\ell, m, n\\}$ is a triplet of integers.\n\n(b) At finite temperatures, the atoms may undergo small deformations\n\n$$\n\\vec{q}_{\\vec{r}}=\\vec{r}+\\vec{u}(\\vec{r})\n$$\n\nwith a cost in potential energy of\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\vec{r}, \\vec{r}^{\\prime} \\atop \\alpha, \\beta} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial q_{\\vec{r}, \\alpha} \\partial q_{\\vec{r}^{\\prime}, \\beta}} u_{\\alpha}(\\vec{r}) u_{\\beta}\\left(\\vec{r}^{\\prime}\\right)+O\\left(u^{3}\\right)\n$$\n\n(c) Finding the normal modes of a crystal is considerably simplified by its translational symmetry. In particular, the matrix of second derivatives only depends on the relative separation of two points,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial q_{\\vec{r}, \\alpha} \\partial q_{\\vec{r}^{\\prime}, \\beta}}=K_{\\alpha \\beta}\\left(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is always possible to take advantage of such a symmetry to at least partially diagonalize the matrix by using a Fourier basis,\n\n$$\nu_{\\alpha}(\\vec{r})=\\sum_{\\vec{k}}^{\\prime} \\frac{e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\n$$\n\nThe sum is restricted to wavevectors $\\vec{k}$ inside a Brillouin zone. For example, in a cubic lattice of spacing $a$, each component of $\\vec{k}$ is restricted to the interval $[-\\pi / a, \\pi / a]$ This is because wavevectors outside this interval carry no additional information as $\\left(k_{x}+2 \\pi m / a\\right)(n a)=k_{x}(n a)+2 m n \\pi$, and any phase that is a multiple of $2 \\pi$ does not effect the sum in eq.(VI.28). In terms of the Fourier modes, the potential energy of deformations is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2 N} \\sum_{\\left(\\vec{r}, \\vec{r}^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(\\vec{k}, \\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\right)}_{\\alpha, \\beta} K_{\\alpha \\beta}\\left(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime}\\right) e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r}} \\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) e^{i \\vec{k}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\vec{r}^{\\prime}} \\tilde{u}_{\\beta}\\left(\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can change variables to relative and center of mass coordinates,\n\n$$\n\\vec{\\rho}=\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\vec{R}=\\frac{\\vec{r}+\\vec{r}^{\\prime}}{2}\n$$\n\nby setting\n\n$$\n\\vec{r}=\\vec{R}+\\frac{\\vec{\\rho}}{2}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\vec{r}^{\\prime}=\\vec{R}-\\frac{\\vec{\\rho}}{2}\n$$\n\nEq.(VI.29) now simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2 N} \\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\vec{k}^{\\prime} \\atop \\alpha, \\beta}\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{R}} e^{i\\left(\\vec{k}+\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{R}}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{\\rho}} K_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{\\rho}) e^{i\\left(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{\\rho} / 2} \\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) \\tilde{u}_{\\beta}\\left(\\vec{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nAs the sum in the first brackets is $N \\delta_{\\vec{k}+\\vec{k}^{\\prime}, 0}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{V} &=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha, \\beta}\\left[\\sum_{\\vec{\\rho}} K_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{\\rho}) e^{i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{\\rho}}\\right] \\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) \\tilde{u}_{\\beta}(-\\vec{k}) \\\\\n&=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha, \\beta} \\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{k}) \\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) \\tilde{u}_{\\beta}(\\vec{k})^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{k})=\\sum_{\\vec{\\rho}} K_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{\\rho}) \\exp (i \\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{\\rho})$, and $\\tilde{u}_{\\beta}(\\vec{k})^{*}=\\tilde{u}_{\\beta}(-\\vec{k})$ is the complex conjugate of $\\tilde{u}_{\\beta}(\\vec{k})$\n\nThe different Fourier modes are thus decoupled at the quadratic order, and the task of diagonalizing the $3 N \\times 3 N$ matrix of second derivatives is reduced to diagonalizing the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $\\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{k})$ separately for each $\\vec{k} .$ The from of $\\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}$ is further restricted by the point group symmetries of the crystal. The discussion of such constraints is beyond the intent of this section and for simplicity we shall assume that $\\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}(\\vec{k})=\\delta_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})$, is already diagonal. (For an isotropic material, this implies a specific relation between bulk and shear moduli.)\n\nThe kinetic energy of deformations is\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m}{2} \\dot{\\vec{q}}_{i}^{2}=\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\frac{m}{2} \\dot{\\tilde{u}}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) \\dot{\\tilde{u}}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})^{*}=\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\frac{1}{2 m} \\tilde{p}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) \\tilde{p}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})^{*}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\tilde{p}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\tilde{u}}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})}=m \\dot{\\tilde{u}}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\n$$\n\nis the momentum conjugate to $\\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k}) .$ The resulting deformation Hamiltonian,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha}\\left[\\frac{1}{2 m}\\left|\\tilde{p}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\\right|^{2}+\\frac{\\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})}{2}\\left|\\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\\right|^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\ndescribes $3 N$ independent harmonic oscillators of frequencies $\\omega_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})=\\sqrt{\\tilde{K}(\\vec{k}) / m}$\n\nIn a classical treatment, each harmonic oscillator of non-zero stiffness contributes $k_{B} T$ to the internal energy of the solid. At most, 6 of the $3 N$ oscillators are expected to have zero stiffness (corresponding to uniform translations and rotations of the crystal). Thus, up to non-extensive corrections of order $1 / N$, the classical internal energy associated with Hamiltonian (VI.33) is $3 N k_{B} T$, leading to a temperature independent heat capacity of $3 k_{B}$ per atom. In fact, the measured heat capacity vanishes at low temperatures. We can again relate this observation to the quantization of the energy levels of each oscillator, as discussed in the previous section. Quantizing each harmonic mode separately, gives the allowed values of the Hamiltonian as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{q}=\\mathcal{V}^{*}+\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\hbar \\omega_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\\left(n_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the set of integers $\\left\\{n_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha}\\right\\}$ describes the quantum micro-state of the oscillators.

In particular, there is an exponential decay of the heat capacity to zero with a characteristic temperature $T_{E}=\\hbar \\omega_{E} / k_{B} .$ However, the experimentally measured heat capacity decays to zero much more slowly, as $T^{3}$\n\nThe discrepancy is resolved through the Debye model, which emphasizes that at low temperatures the main contribution to heat capacity is from the oscillators of lowest frequency that are the most easily excited. The lowest energy modes in turn correspond to smallest wavevectors $k=|\\vec{k}|$, or longest wavelengths $\\lambda=2 \\pi / k .$ Indeed, the modes with $\\vec{k}=0$ simply describe pure translations of the lattice and have zero stiffness. By continuity we expect, $\\lim _{\\vec{k} \\rightarrow 0} \\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})=0$, and ignoring considerations of crystal symmetry, the expansion of $\\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})$ at small wavevectors takes the form\n\n$$\n\\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})=B k^{2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(k^{4}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe odd terms are absent in the expansion, since $\\tilde{K}(\\vec{k})=\\tilde{K}(-\\vec{k})$ follows from $K\\left(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime}\\right)=$ $K\\left(\\vec{r}^{\\prime}-\\vec{r}\\right)$ in real space. The corresponding frequencies at long wavelengths are\n\n$$\n\\omega(\\vec{k})=\\sqrt{\\frac{B k^{2}}{m}}=v k\n$$\n\nwhere $v=\\sqrt{B / m}$ is the speed of sound in the crystal. (In a real material, $\\tilde{K}_{\\alpha \\beta}$ is not proportional to $\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}$, and different polarizations of sound have different velocities.)\n\nThe quanta of vibrational modes are usually referred to as phonons. Using the dispersion relation in eq.(VI.40), the contribution of phonons to the internal energy is\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{q}\\right\\rangle=E_{0}+\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\frac{\\hbar v k}{e^{\\beta \\hbar v k}-1}\n$$\n\nWith periodic boundary conditions in a box of dimensions $L_{x} \\times L_{y} \\times L_{z}$, the allowed wavevectors are\n\n$$\n\\vec{k}=\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi n_{x}}{L_{x}}, \\frac{2 \\pi n_{y}}{L_{y}}, \\frac{2 \\pi n_{z}}{L_{z}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $n_{x}, n_{y}$, and $n_{z}$ are integers. In the large size limit, these modes are very densely packed, and the number of modes in a volume element $d^{3} \\vec{k}$ is\n\n$$\nd \\mathcal{N}=\\frac{d k_{x}}{2 \\pi / L_{x}} \\frac{d k_{y}}{2 \\pi / L_{y}} \\frac{d k_{x}}{2 \\pi / L_{z}}=\\frac{V}{(2 \\pi)^{3}} d^{3} \\vec{k} \\equiv \\rho d^{3} \\vec{k}\n$$\n\nUsing the phase space density $\\rho$, any sum over allowed wavevectors can be replaced by an integral as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{V \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{\\vec{k}} f(\\vec{k})=\\int d^{3} \\vec{k} \\rho f(\\vec{k})\n$$\n\nHence, eq.(VI.41) can be re-written as\n\n$$\nE=E_{0}+3 V \\int^{B . Z} \\quad \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{k}}{(2 \\pi)^{3}} \\frac{\\hbar v k}{e^{\\beta \\hbar v k}-1}\n$$\n\nwhere the integral is performed over the volume of the Brillouin zone, and the factor of 3 comes from assuming the same sound velocity for the three polarizations.\n\nDue to its dependence on the shape of the Brillouin zone, it is not possible to give a simple closed form expression for the energy in eq.(VI.45). However, we can examine its high and low temperature limits. The characteristic temperature separating the two limits,\n\n$$\nT_{D}=\\frac{\\hbar v k_{\\max }}{k_{B}} \\approx \\frac{\\hbar v}{k_{B}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{a}\n$$\n\ncorresponds to the high frequency modes at the edge of the zone. For $T \\gg T_{D}$, all modes behave classically. The integrand of eq.(VI.45) is just $k_{B} T$, and since the total number of modes is $3 N=3 V \\int^{\\text {B.Z. }} d^{3} \\vec{k} /(2 \\pi)^{3}$, the classical results of $E(T)=E_{0}+3 N k_{B} T$, and $C=3 N k_{B}$ are recovered. For $T \\ll T_{D}$, the factor $\\exp (\\beta \\hbar v k)$ in the denominator of eq.(VI.45) is very large at the Brillouin zone edge. The most important contribution to the integral comes from small $k$, and the error in extending the integration range to infinity is small. After changing variables to $x=\\beta \\hbar v|\\vec{k}|$, and using $d^{3} \\vec{k}=4 \\pi x^{2} d x /(\\beta \\hbar v)^{3}$ due to spherical symmetry, eq.(VI.45) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{T \\ll T_{D}} E(T) & \\approx E_{0}+\\frac{3 V}{8 \\pi^{3}}\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar v}\\right)^{3} 4 \\pi k_{B} T \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d x \\frac{x^{3}}{e^{x}-1} \\\\\n&=E_{0}+\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{10} V\\left(\\frac{k T}{\\hbar v}\\right)^{3} k_{B} T\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(The value of the definite integral, $\\pi^{4} / 15 \\approx 6.5$, can be found in standard tables.) The resulting heat capacity,\n\n$$\nC=\\frac{d E}{d T}=k_{B} V \\frac{2 \\pi^{2}}{5}\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar v}\\right)^{3}\n$$\n\nhas the form $C \\propto N k_{B}\\left(T / T_{D}\\right)^{3}$ in agreement with observations. The physical interpretation of this result is the following: At temperatures $T \\ll T_{D}$, only a fraction of the phonon modes can be thermally excited. These are the low frequency phonons with energy quanta $\\hbar \\omega(\\vec{k}) \\ll k_{B} T .$ The excited phonons have wavevectors $|\\vec{k}|<k^{*}(T) \\approx\\left(k_{B} T / \\hbar v\\right)$ Quite generally, in $d$ space dimensions, the number of these modes is approximately $V k^{*}(T)^{d} \\sim V\\left(k_{B} T / \\hbar v\\right)^{d} .$ Each excited mode can be treated classically, and contributes roughly $k_{B} T$ to the internal energy which thus scales as $E \\sim V\\left(k_{B} T / \\hbar v\\right)^{d} k_{B} T .$ The corresponding heat capacity, $C \\sim V k_{B}\\left(k_{B} T / \\hbar v\\right)^{d}$, vanishes as $T^{d}$. \n\n\\section{VI.C Black-body Radiation}\n\nPhonons correspond to vibrations of a solid medium. There are also (longitudinal) sound modes in liquid and gas states. However, even \"empty\" vacuum, can support fluctuations of the electromagnetic (EM) field, photons, which can be thermally excited at finite temperatures. The normal modes of this field are EM waves, characterized by a wave-number $\\vec{k}$, and two possible polarizations $\\alpha .$ (Since $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}=0$ in free space, the electric field must be normal to $\\vec{k}$, and only transverse modes exist.) With appropriate choice of coordinates, the Hamiltonian for the EM field can be written as a sum of harmonic oscillators,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha}\\left[\\left|\\tilde{p}_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha}\\right|^{2}+\\omega_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})^{2}\\left|\\tilde{u}_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})\\right|^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nwith $\\omega_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})=c k$, where $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWith periodic boundary conditions, the allowed wavevectors in a box of size $L$ are $\\vec{k}=2 \\pi\\left(n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z}\\right) / L$ where $\\left\\{n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z}\\right\\}$ are integers. However, unlike phonons, there is no Brillouin zone limiting the size of $\\vec{k}$, and these integers can be arbitrarily large. The lack of such a restriction leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe in a classical treatment: As there is no limit to the wavevector, assigning $k_{B} T$ per mode leads to an infinite energy stored in the high frequency modes. (The low frequencies are cut off by the finite size of the box.) It was indeed to resolve this difficulty that Planck suggested that the allowed values of EM energy must be quantized according to the Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{q}=\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\hbar c k\\left(n_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})+\\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\quad n_{\\alpha}(\\vec{k})=0,1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nAs for phonons, the internal energy is calculated from\n\n$$\nE=\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{q}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\vec{k}, \\alpha} \\hbar c k\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar c k}}{1-e^{-\\beta \\hbar c k}}\\right)=V E_{0}+\\frac{2 V}{(2 \\pi)^{3}} \\int d^{3} \\vec{k} \\frac{\\hbar c k}{e^{\\beta \\hbar c k}-1}\n$$\n\nThe zero-point energy is actually infinite, but as only energy differences are measured, it is usually ignored.

At lower temperatures, attractive interactions lead to condensation into the liquid state. The qualitative behavior of the phase diagram is the same for most simple gases. There is a line of transitions in the coordinates $(P, T)$ (corresponding to the coexistence of liquid and gas in the $(V, T)$ plane) that terminates at a so called critical point. It is thus possible to transform a liquid to a gas without encountering any singularities. Since the ideal gas law is universal, i.e. independent of material, we may hope that there is also a generalized universal equation of state (presumably more complicated) that describes interacting gases, including liquid/gas condensation phenomena. This hope motivated the search for a law of corresponding states, obtained by appropriate rescalings of state functions. The most natural choice of scales for pressure, volume, and temperature are those of the critical point, $\\left(P_{c}, V_{c}, T_{c}\\right)$\n\nThe van der Waals equation is an example of a generalized equation of state. Its critical point is found by setting $\\partial P /\\left.\\partial V\\right|_{T}$ and $\\partial^{2} P /\\left.\\partial V^{2}\\right|_{T}$ to zero. The former is the limit of the flat coexistence portion of liquid/gas isotherms; the latter follows from the stability requirement $\\kappa_{T}>0$ (see the discussion after eq.(I.72)).

However, we can scale out such dependencies by measuring $P, T$, and $v$ in units of $P_{c}, T_{c}$ and $v_{c} .$ Setting $P_{r}=P / P_{c}, v_{r}=v / v_{c}$, and $T_{r}=T / T_{c}$, a reduced version of the van der Waals equation is obtained as\n\n$$\nP_{r}=\\frac{8}{3} \\frac{T_{r}}{v_{r}-1 / 3}-\\frac{3}{v_{r}^{2}}\n$$\n\nWe have thus constructed a universal (material independent) equation of state.

This is not particularly surprising given the differences in the underlying Hamiltonians. We know rigorously from the virial expansion that perturbative treatment of the interacting gas does depend on the details of the mi croscopic potential. Thus the hope of finding a universal equation of state for all liquids and gases has no theoretical or experimental justification; each case has to be studied separately starting from its microscopic Hamiltonian. It is thus quite surprising that the collapse of experimental data does in fact work very well in the vicinity of the critical point, as described in the next section. \n\n\\section{V.H Critical Point Behavior}\n\nTo account for the universal behavior of gases close to their critical point, let us examine the isotherms in the vicinity of $\\left(P_{c}, v_{c}, T_{c}\\right) .$ For $T \\geq T_{c}$, a Taylor expansion of $P(T, v)$ in the vicinity of $v_{c}$, for any $T$ gives,\n\n$$\nP(T, v)=P\\left(T, v_{c}\\right)+\\left.\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial v}\\right|_{T}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)+\\left.\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} P}{\\partial v^{2}}\\right|_{T}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{2}+\\left.\\frac{1}{6} \\frac{\\partial^{3} P}{\\partial v^{3}}\\right|_{T}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\n$$\n\nSince $\\partial P /\\left.\\partial v\\right|_{T}$ and $\\partial^{2} P /\\left.\\partial v^{2}\\right|_{T}$ are both zero at $T_{c}$, the expansion of the derivatives around the critical point gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP\\left(T, v_{c}\\right) &=P_{c}+\\alpha\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left[(T-T)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial v}\\right|_{T, v_{c}} &=-a\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left[\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2} P}{\\partial v^{2}}\\right|_{T, v_{c}} &=b\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left[(T-T)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{3} P}{\\partial v^{3}}\\right|_{T_{c}, v_{c}} &=-c+\\mathcal{O}\\left[\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $a, b$, and $c$ are material dependent constants.

If an analytical expansion is possible, the isotherms of any gas in the vicinity of its critical point must have the general form,\n\n$$\nP(T, v)=P_{c}+\\alpha\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)-a\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)\\left(v-v_{C}\\right)+\\frac{b}{2}\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{c}{6}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\n$$\n\nNote that the third and fifth terms are of comparable magnitude for $\\left(T-T_{c}\\right) \\sim\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{2}$ The fourth (and higher order terms) can then be neglected when this condition is satisfied. - The analytic expansion of eq.(V.83) results in the following predictions for behavior close to the critical point:\n\n(a) The gas compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point from the high temperature side, along the critical isochore $\\left(v=v_{c}\\right)$ as,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{+}} \\kappa\\left(T, v_{c}\\right)=-\\left.\\frac{1}{v_{c}} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial v}\\right|_{T} ^{-1}=\\frac{1}{v_{c} a\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)}\n$$\n\n(b) The critical isotherm $\\left(T=T_{c}\\right)$ behaves as\n\n$$\nP=P_{c}-\\frac{c}{6}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\n$$\n\n(c) Eq.(V.83) is manifestly inapplicable to $T<T_{c} .$ However, we can try to extract information for the low temperature side by applying the Maxwell construction to the unstable isotherms. Actually, dimensional considerations are sufficient to show that on approaching $T_{c}$ from the low temperature side, the specific volumes of the coexisting liquid and gas phases approach each other as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(v_{\\text {gas }}-v_{\\text {liquid }}\\right) \\propto\\left(T_{c}-T\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe liquid-gas transition for $T<T_{c}$ is accompanied by a discontinuity in density, and the release of latent heat $L .$ This kind of transition is usually referred to as first order or discontinuous. The difference between the two phases disappears as the line of first order transitions terminates at the critical point. The singular behavior at this point is attributed to a second order or continuous transition. Eq.(V.83) follows from no more than the constraints of mechanical stability, and the assumption of analytical isotherms. Although there are some unknown coefficients, eqs.(V.85)-(V.86) predict universal forms for the singularities close to the critical point and can be compared to experimental data. The experimental results do indeed confirm the general expectations of singular behavior, and there is universality in the results for different gases which can be summarized as\n\n(a) The compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{+}} \\kappa\\left(T, v_{c}\\right) \\propto\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)^{-\\gamma}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\gamma \\approx 1.3\n$$\n\n(b) The critical isotherm behaves as\n\n$$\n\\left(P-P_{c}\\right) \\propto\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{\\delta}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\delta \\approx 5.0\n$$\n\n(c) The difference between liquid and gas densities vanishes close to the critical point as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(\\rho_{\\text {liquid }}-\\rho_{\\text {gas }}\\right) \\propto \\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(v_{\\text {gas }}-v_{\\text {liquid }}\\right) \\propto\\left(T_{c}-T\\right)^{\\beta}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\beta \\approx 0.3\n$$\n\nThese results clearly indicate that the assumption of analyticity of the isotherms, leading to eq.(V.83), is not correct. The exponents $\\delta, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ appearing in eqs.(V.88)(V.89) are known as critical indices. Understanding the origin, universality, and numerical values of these exponents is the a fascinating subject explored in the modern theory of critical phenomena.

While the first few terms in the virial series slightly modify the behavior of the gas, an infinite number of terms have to be summed to obtain the condensation transition. An alternative, but approximate, method for dealing with strongly interacting systems is the use of variational methods.\n\nSuppose that in an appropriate ensemble we need to calculate $Z=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}\\right) .$ In the canonical formulation, $Z$ is the partition function corresponding to the Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}$ at temperature $k_{B} T=1 / \\beta$, and for a classical system tr refers to the integral over the phase space of $N$ particles.

If an analytical expansion is possible, the isotherms of any gas in the vicinity of its critical point must have the general form,\n\n$$\nP(T, v)=P_{c}+\\alpha\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)-a\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)\\left(v-v_{C}\\right)+\\frac{b}{2}\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{c}{6}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\n$$\n\nNote that the third and fifth terms are of comparable magnitude for $\\left(T-T_{c}\\right) \\sim\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{2}$ The fourth (and higher order terms) can then be neglected when this condition is satisfied. - The analytic expansion of eq.(V.83) results in the following predictions for behavior close to the critical point:\n\n(a) The gas compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point from the high temperature side, along the critical isochore $\\left(v=v_{c}\\right)$ as,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{+}} \\kappa\\left(T, v_{c}\\right)=-\\left.\\frac{1}{v_{c}} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial v}\\right|_{T} ^{-1}=\\frac{1}{v_{c} a\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)}\n$$\n\n(b) The critical isotherm $\\left(T=T_{c}\\right)$ behaves as\n\n$$\nP=P_{c}-\\frac{c}{6}\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{3}+\\cdots\n$$\n\n(c) Eq.(V.83) is manifestly inapplicable to $T<T_{c} .$ However, we can try to extract information for the low temperature side by applying the Maxwell construction to the unstable isotherms. Actually, dimensional considerations are sufficient to show that on approaching $T_{c}$ from the low temperature side, the specific volumes of the coexisting liquid and gas phases approach each other as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(v_{\\text {gas }}-v_{\\text {liquid }}\\right) \\propto\\left(T_{c}-T\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe liquid-gas transition for $T<T_{c}$ is accompanied by a discontinuity in density, and the release of latent heat $L .$ This kind of transition is usually referred to as first order or discontinuous. The difference between the two phases disappears as the line of first order transitions terminates at the critical point. The singular behavior at this point is attributed to a second order or continuous transition. Eq.(V.83) follows from no more than the constraints of mechanical stability, and the assumption of analytical isotherms. Although there are some unknown coefficients, eqs.(V.85)-(V.86) predict universal forms for the singularities close to the critical point and can be compared to experimental data. The experimental results do indeed confirm the general expectations of singular behavior, and there is universality in the results for different gases which can be summarized as\n\n(a) The compressibility diverges on approaching the critical point as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{+}} \\kappa\\left(T, v_{c}\\right) \\propto\\left(T-T_{c}\\right)^{-\\gamma}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\gamma \\approx 1.3\n$$\n\n(b) The critical isotherm behaves as\n\n$$\n\\left(P-P_{c}\\right) \\propto\\left(v-v_{c}\\right)^{\\delta}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\delta \\approx 5.0\n$$\n\n(c) The difference between liquid and gas densities vanishes close to the critical point as\n\n$$\n\\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(\\rho_{\\text {liquid }}-\\rho_{\\text {gas }}\\right) \\propto \\lim _{T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{-}}\\left(v_{\\text {gas }}-v_{\\text {liquid }}\\right) \\propto\\left(T_{c}-T\\right)^{\\beta}, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\beta \\approx 0.3\n$$\n\nThese results clearly indicate that the assumption of analyticity of the isotherms, leading to eq.(V.83), is not correct. The exponents $\\delta, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ appearing in eqs.(V.88)(V.89) are known as critical indices. Understanding the origin, universality, and numerical values of these exponents is the a fascinating subject explored in the modern theory of critical phenomena.

As discussed before, the two-body potential is characterized by a hard core repulsion at short distances and a van der Waals attraction at large distances. To make the computations easier, we shall use the following approximation for the potential,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}(r)= \\begin{cases}+\\infty & \\text { for } r<r_{0} \\\\ -u_{0}\\left(r_{0} / r\\right)^{6} & \\text { for } r>r_{0}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich combines both features.

Yet, its integral in eq.(V.39) is dominated by contributions from the short scales $r_{0} .$ In this limited context, the van der Waals potential is short-ranged, and results in corrections to the ideal gas behavior that are analytical in density $n$, leading to the virial series.\n\n(2) By contrast, potentials that fall off with separation as $1 / r^{3}$ or slower, are long-ranged. The integral appearing in calculation of the second virial coefficient is dominated by long distances, and is divergent. As a result, corrections to the ideal gas behavior can not be written in the form of a virial series, and are in fact non-analytic. A good example is provided by the Coulomb interactions (see problems for the test), where the non-analytic corrections can be obtained by summing all the ring diagrams in the cumulant (or cluster) expansions.\n\n(3) The second virial coefficient has dimensions of volume, and (for short-range potentials) is proportional to the atomic volume $\\Omega .$ In the high temperature limit, the importance of corrections to ideal gas behavior can be estimated by comparing the first two terms of eq. $(\\mathrm{V} .14)$\n\n$$\n\\frac{B_{2} n^{2}}{n}=\\frac{B_{2}}{n^{-1}} \\sim \\frac{\\text { Atomic volume }}{\\text { volume per particle in gas }} \\sim \\frac{\\text { gas density }}{\\text { liquid density }}\n$$\n\nThis ratio is roughly $10^{-3}$ for air at room temperature and pressure. The corrections to ideal gas behavior are thus small at low densities. On dimensional grounds, a similar ratio is expected for the higher order terms, $B_{\\ell} n^{\\ell} / B_{\\ell-1} n^{\\ell-1}$, in the virial series. We may thus suspect the convergence of the series at high enough densities (when the gas liquifies).\n\n(4) The virial expansion breaks down not only at high densities, but also at low temperatures. This is suggested by the divergences in eqs.(V.40) and (V.38) as $T \\rightarrow 0$, and reflects the fact that in the presence of attractive interactions the particles can lower their energy at low temperatures by condensing into a liquid state.\n\n(5) The truncated virial expansion,\n\n$$\n\\frac{P}{k_{B} T}=n+\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{u_{0}}{k_{B} T}\\right) n^{2}+\\cdots\n$$\n\ncan be rearranged as\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{B} T}\\left(P+\\frac{u_{0} \\Omega}{2} n^{2}\\right)=n\\left(1+n \\frac{\\Omega}{2}+\\cdots\\right) \\approx \\frac{n}{1-n \\Omega / 2}=\\frac{N}{V-N \\Omega / 2}\n$$\n\nThis is precisely in the form of the van der Waals equation\n\n$$\n\\left[P+\\frac{u_{0} \\Omega}{2}\\left(\\frac{N}{V}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\left[V-\\frac{N \\Omega}{2}\\right]=N k_{B} T\n$$\n\nand we can identify the van der Waals parameters, $a=u_{0} \\Omega / 2$ and $b=\\Omega / 2$.\n\n- Physical interpretation of the van der Waals equation: Historically, van der Waals suggested eq.(V.44) on the basis of experimental results for the equation of state of various gases, towards the end of the19th century. At that time the microscopic interactions between gas particles were not known, and van der Waals postulated the necessity of an attractive interaction between gas atoms based on the observed decreases in pressure. It was only later on that such interactions were observed directly, and then attributed to the induced dipole-dipole forces by London. The physical justification of the correction terms is as follows.\n\n(a) There is a correction to the gas volume $V$ due to the hard core exclusions. At first sight, it may appear surprising that the excluded volume $b$, in eq.(V.44) is one half of the volume that is excluded around each particle. This is because this factor measures a joint excluded volume involving all particles in phase space. In fact, the contribution of coordinates to the partition function of the hard-core gas can be estimated at low densities, from\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{N}=\\int^{\\prime} \\frac{\\prod_{i} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i}}{N !}=\\frac{1}{N !} V(V-\\Omega)(V-2 \\Omega) \\cdots(V-(N-1) \\Omega) \\approx \\frac{1}{N !}\\left(V-\\frac{N \\Omega}{2}\\right)^{N}\n$$\n\nThe above result is obtained by adding particles one at a time, and noting that the available volume for the $m^{\\text {th }}$ particle is $(V-m \\Omega)$. At low densities, the overall effect is a reduction of the volume available to each particle by approximately $\\Omega / 2 .$ Of course, the above result is only approximate, since the effects of excluded volume involving more than two particles are not correctly taken into account. The relatively simple form of eq.(V.45) is only exact at for spatial dimensions $d=1$ and infinity. As proved in problems for the test, the exact excluded volume in $d=1$ is in fact $\\Omega$.\n\n(b) The decrease in pressure $P$, due to attractive interactions, is somewhat harder to quantify. In sec.III.F, the gas pressure was related to the impacts of particles on a wall via\n\n$$\nP=\\left.\\overline{\\left(n v_{x}\\right)\\left(2 m v_{x}\\right)}\\right|_{v_{x}<0}=n m \\overline{v_{x}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere the first term is the number of collisions per unit time and area, while the second is the momentum imparted by each particle. For the ideal gas, the usual equation of state is recovered by noting that the average kinetic energy is $m \\overline{v_{x}^{2}} / 2=k_{B} T / 2 . \\quad$ Attractive interactions lead to a reduction in pressure given by\n\n$$\n\\delta P=\\delta n\\left(m \\overline{v_{x}^{2}}\\right)+n \\delta\\left(m \\overline{v_{x}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhile different statistical ensembles give the same pressure, which is a bulk state function, they may lead to different behaviors at the surface. We must thus be careful, and consistent, in evaluation of eq.(V.47), which depends of surface properties. In a canonical ensemble, the gas density is reduced at the walls. This is because the particles in the middle of the box experience an attractive potential $V$ from all sides, while at the edge only an attractive energy of $V / 2$ is available from half of the space. The resulting change in density is approximately\n\n$$\n\\delta n \\approx n\\left(e^{-\\beta V / 2}-e^{-\\beta V}\\right) \\approx \\beta n V / 2\n$$\n\nIntegrating the interaction of one particle in the bulk with the rest gives\n\n$$\nV=\\int d^{3} \\vec{r} \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{attr} .}(r) n=-n \\Omega u_{0}\n$$\n\nThe change in density thus gives the pressure correction of $\\delta P=-n^{2} \\Omega u_{0} / 2$ calculated in eq.(V.44). There is no correction to the kinetic energy of the particles impinging on the wall, since in the canonical formulation the probabilites for momentum and location of the particles are independent variables. The probability distribution for momentum is uniform in space, giving the average kinetic energy of $k_{B} T / 2$ for each direction of motion.\n\nA different explanation is presented in a kinetic formulation in which particles follow the deterministic Hamiltonian equations of motion. In this formulation, the impinging particles lose kinetic energy in approaching the wall from the surface, since they have to climb out of the potential well set up by the attractions of bulk particles. The reduction in kinetic energy is given by\n\n$$\n\\delta \\frac{m v_{x}^{2}}{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{r} \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{attr} .}(r) n=-\\frac{1}{2} n \\Omega u_{0}\n$$\n\nThe reduced velocities lead to an increase in the surface density in this case, as the slower particles spend a longer time $\\tau$ in the vicinity of the wall! The relative change in density is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta n}{n}=\\frac{\\delta \\tau}{\\tau}=-\\frac{\\delta v_{x}}{v_{x}}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\delta v_{x}^{2}}{v_{x}^{2}}, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\delta n=-\\beta n V / 2\n$$\n\nThe increase in density is precisely the opposite of the result of eq.(V.48) in the canonical formulation. However, with the decrease in kinetic energy calculated in eq.(V.50), it again leads to the correct reduction in pressure. \n\n\\section{V.D Breakdown of the van der Waals equation}\n\nAs discussed in sec.I.I, mechanical stability of a gas requires the positivity of the isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_{T}=-V^{-1} \\partial V /\\left.\\partial P\\right|_{T} .$ This condition can be obtained by examining density fluctuations in a grand canonical ensemble. The probability of finding $N$ particles in a volume $V$ is given by eq.(IV.102) as\n\n$$\np(N, V)=\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z(T, N, V)}{\\mathcal{Q}}\n$$\n\nSince for a gas $\\ln \\mathcal{Q}=-\\beta \\mathcal{G}=P V / k_{B} T$, eqs. $(\\mathrm{IV} .103)$ and (IV.104) simplify to\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n\\langle N\\rangle_{c}=N=\\frac{\\partial(\\ln \\mathcal{Q})}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)}=\\left.V \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\mu}\\right|_{T, V} \\\\\n\\left\\langle N^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}=\\frac{\\partial^{2}(\\ln \\mathcal{Q})}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)^{2}}=\\frac{\\partial\\langle N\\rangle_{c}}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)}=\\left.k_{B} T \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial \\mu}\\right|_{T, V}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nDividing the two equations, and using the chain rule, results in\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left\\langle N^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}}{N}=\\left.\\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial P}\\right|_{T, V}=-\\left.\\left.\\frac{k_{B} T}{V} \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial V}\\right|_{P, T} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right|_{N, T}=n k_{B} T \\kappa_{T}\n$$\n\nThe positivity of $\\kappa_{T}$ is thus tied to that of the variance of $N$. A stable value of $N$ corresponds to a maximum of the probability $p(N, V)$, i.e. a positive compressibility. A negative $\\kappa_{T}$ actually corresponds to a minimum in $p(N, V)$ implying that the system is least likely to be found at such densities. Fluctuations in density will then occur spontaneously and change the density to a stable value.\n\nAny approximate equation of state, such as the van der Waals equation, must at least satisfy the stability requirements. However, the van der Waals isotherms contain a portion with $-\\partial P /\\left.\\partial V\\right|_{T}<0$, for temperatures less than a critical value $T_{c} .$ The negative compressibility implies an instability towards forming domains of lower and higher density, i.e. phase separation. The attractive interactions in real gases do indeed result in a liquidgas phase separation at low temperatures. The isotherms then include a flat portion, $\\partial P /\\left.\\partial V\\right|_{T}=0$, at the coexistence of the two phases. Can the (unstable) van der Waals isotherms be used to construct the phase diagram of a real gas?\n\nOne way of doing so is by the following Maxwell construction: The variations of the chemical potential $\\mu(T, P)$, along an isotherm are obtained by integrating eq.(V.53), as\n\n$$\nd \\mu=\\frac{V}{N} d P, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\mu(T, P)=\\mu\\left(T, P_{A}\\right)+\\int_{P_{A}}^{P} d P^{\\prime} \\frac{V\\left(T, P^{\\prime}\\right)}{N}\n$$\n\nSince the van der Waals isotherms for $T<T_{c}$ are non-monotonic, there is a range of pressures that correspond to three different values, $\\left\\{\\mu_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$, of the chemical potential. The possibility of several values of $\\mu$ at a given temperature and pressure indicates phase coexistence. In equilibrium, the number of particles in each phase $N_{\\alpha}$, adjusts so as to minimize the Gibbs free energy $G=\\sum_{\\alpha} \\mu_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha} .$ Clearly, the phase with lowest $\\mu_{\\alpha}$ will acquire all the particles. A phase transition occurs when two branches of allowed chemical potentials intersect. From eq.(V.55), the critical pressure $P_{c}$, for this intersection is obtained from the condition\n\n$$\n\\oint_{P_{c}}^{P_{c}} d P^{\\prime} V\\left(T, P^{\\prime}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nA geometrical interpretation of the above result is that $P_{c}$ corresponds to a pressure that encloses equal areas of the non-monotonic isotherm on each side. The Maxwell construction approach to phase condensation is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it relies on integrating a clearly unphysical portion the van der Waals isotherm. A better approach that makes the approximations involved more apparent is presented in the next section.\n\n\\section{V.E Mean Field Theory of Condensation}\n\nIn principle, all properties of the interacting system, including phase separation, are contained within the thermodynamic potentials that can be obtained by evaluating $Z(T, N)$ or $\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu) .$ Phase transitions, however, are characterized by discontinuities in various state functions and must correspond to the appearance of singularities in the partition functions. At first glance, it is somewhat surprising that any singular behavior should emerge from computing such well behaved integrals (for short-ranged interactions) as\n\n$$\nZ(T, N, V)=\\int \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i}}{N ! h^{3 N}} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2 m}-\\beta \\sum_{i<j} \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nInstead of evaluating the integrals perturbatively, we shall now set up a reasonable approximation scheme. The contributions of the hard core and attractive portions of the potential are again treated separately, and the partition function approximated by\n\n$$\nZ(T, N, V) \\approx \\frac{1}{N !} \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{3 N}} \\underbrace{V(V-\\Omega) \\cdots(V-(N-1) \\Omega)}_{\\text {Excluded volume effects }} \\exp (-\\beta \\bar{U})\n$$\n\nHere $\\bar{U}$ represents an average attraction energy, obtained by assuming a uniform density $n=N / V$, as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{U} &=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j} \\mathcal{V}_{\\text {attr. }}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{r}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{r}_{2} n\\left(\\vec{r}_{1}\\right) n\\left(\\vec{r}_{2}\\right) \\mathcal{V}_{\\text {attr. }}\\left(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{n^{2}}{2} V \\int d^{3} \\vec{r} \\mathcal{V}_{\\text {attr. }}(\\vec{r}) \\equiv-\\frac{N^{2}}{2 V} u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe parameter $u$ describes the net effect of the attractive interactions. Substituting into eq.(V.58) leads to the following approximation for the partition function\n\n$$\nZ(T, N, V) \\approx \\frac{(V-N \\Omega / 2)^{N}}{N ! \\lambda^{3 N}} \\exp \\left[\\frac{\\beta u N^{2}}{2 V}\\right]\n$$\n\nFrom the resulting free energy,\n\n$$\nF=-k_{B} T \\ln Z=-N k_{B} T \\ln (V-N \\Omega / 2)+N k_{B} T \\ln (N / e)+3 N k_{B} T \\ln \\lambda-\\frac{u N^{2}}{2 V}\n$$\n\nwe obtain the expression for the pressure in the canonical ensemble as\n\n$$\nP_{\\text {can }}=-\\left.\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right|_{T, N}=\\frac{N k_{B} T}{V-N \\Omega / 2}-\\frac{u N^{2}}{2 V^{2}}\n$$\n\nRemarkably, the uniform density approximation reproduces the van der Waals equation of state. However, the self-consistency of this approximation can now be checked. As long as $\\kappa_{T}$ is positive, eq.(V.54) implies that the variance of density vanishes for large volumes as $\\left\\langle n^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}=k_{B} T n^{2} \\kappa_{T} / V .$ But $\\kappa_{T}$ diverges at $T_{c}$, and at lower temperatures its negativity implies an instability towards density fluctuations as discussed in the previous section. When condensation occurs, there is phase separation into high (liquid) and low (gas) density states, and the uniform density assumption becomes manifestly incorrect. This difficulty is circumvented in the grand canonical ensemble. Once the chemical potential is fixed, the number of particles (and hence density) in this ensemble is automatically adjusted to that of the appropriate phase.\n\nAs the assumption of a uniform density is correct for both the liquid and gas phases, we can use the approximations of eqs.(V.59) and (V.60) to estimate the grand partition function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, V)=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z(T, N, V) \\approx \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\exp \\left[N \\ln \\left(\\frac{V}{N}-\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\beta u N^{2}}{2 V}+\\Delta N\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta=1+\\beta \\mu-\\ln \\left(\\lambda^{3}\\right) .$ As in any sum over exponentials in $N$, the above expression is dominated by a particular value of particle number (hence density), and given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, V) \\approx \\exp \\left\\{\\max \\left[N \\Delta+N \\ln \\left(\\frac{V}{N}-\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\beta u N^{2}}{2 V}\\right]_{N}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHence, the grand canonical expression for the gas pressure is obtained from\n\n$$\n\\beta P_{\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{c}}=\\frac{\\ln \\mathcal{Q}}{V}=\\max [\\Psi(n)]_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\Psi(n)=n \\Delta+n \\ln \\left(n^{-1}-\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\beta u}{2} n^{2}\n$$\n\nThe possible values of density are obtained from $d \\Psi /\\left.d n\\right|_{n_{\\alpha}}=0$, and satisfy\n\n$$\n\\Delta=-\\ln \\left(n_{\\alpha}^{-1}-\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{1-n_{\\alpha} \\Omega / 2}-\\beta u n_{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nThe above equation in fact admits multiple solutions $n_{\\alpha}$ for the density. Substituting the resulting $\\Delta$ into eq.(V.65) leads after some manipulation to\n\n$$\nP_{\\text {g.c. }}=\\max \\left[\\frac{n_{\\alpha} k_{B} T}{1-n_{\\alpha} \\Omega / 2}-\\frac{u}{2} n_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right]_{\\alpha}=\\max \\left[P_{\\text {can }}\\left(n_{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]_{\\alpha}\n$$\n\ni.e. the grand canonical and canonical values of pressure are identical at a particular density. However, if eq.(V.67) admits multiple solutions for the density at a particular chemical potential, the correct density is uniquely determined as the one that maximizes the canonical expression for pressure (or for $\\psi(n)$ ).\n\nThe mechanism for the liquid-gas phase transition is therefore the following. The sum in eq.(V.63) is dominated by two large terms at the liquid and gas densities. At a particular chemical potential, the stable phase is determined by the larger of the two terms. The phase transition occurs when the dominant term changes upon varying the temperature.

The resulting series is organized in powers of the density $N / V$, and is most suitable for obtaining a virial expansion, which expresses the deviations from the ideal gas equation of state in a power series\n\n$$\n\\frac{P}{k_{B} T}=\\frac{N}{V}\\left[1+B_{2}(T) \\frac{N}{V}+B_{3}(T)\\left(\\frac{N}{V}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots\\right]\n$$\n\nThe temperature dependent parameters, $B_{i}(T)$, are known as the virial coefficients and originate from the inter-particle interactions. Our initial goal is to compute these coefficients from first principles.\n\nTo illustrate a different method of expansion, we shall perform computations in the grand canonical ensemble. With a macro-state $M \\equiv(T, \\mu, V)$, the grand partition function is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}(\\mu, T, V)=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z(N, T, V)=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{N !}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{N} \\mathcal{S}_{N}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{N}=\\int \\prod_{i=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i} \\prod_{i<j}\\left(1+f_{i j}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $f_{i j}=f\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)$.\n\nThe $2^{N(N-1) / 2}$ terms in $\\mathcal{S}_{N}$ can now be ordered in powers of $f_{i j}$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{N}=\\int \\prod_{i=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i}\\left(1+\\sum_{i<j} f_{i j}+\\sum_{i<j, k<l} f_{i j} f_{k l}+\\cdots\\right)\n$$\n\nAn efficient method for organizing the perturbation series is to represent the various contributions diagrammatically. In particular we shall apply the following conventions:\n\n(a) Draw $N$ dots labelled by $i=1, \\cdots, N$ to represent the coordinates $\\vec{q}_{1}$ through $\\vec{q}_{N}$\n\n(b) Each term in eq.(V.17) corresponds to a product of $f_{i j}$, represented by drawing lines connecting $i$ and $j$ for each $f_{i j} .$ For example, the graph,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lllllll}\n\\bullet & \\bullet-\\bullet & \\bullet-\\bullet-\\bullet & \\multirow{2}{*} {6} & \\bullet \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & & N\n\\end{array},\n$$\n\nrepresents the integral\n\n$$\n\\left(\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)\\left(\\int d^{3} \\overrightarrow{q_{2}} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{3} f_{23}\\right)\\left(\\int d^{3} \\overrightarrow{q_{4}} d^{3} \\overrightarrow{q_{5}} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{6} f_{45} f_{56}\\right) \\cdots\\left(\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{N}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs the above example indicates, the value of each graph is the product of the contributions from its linked clusters. Since these clusters are more fundamental, we reformulate the sum in terms of them by defining a quantity $b_{\\ell}$, equal to the sum over all $\\ell$ -particle linked clusters (one-particle irreducible or not). For example\n\n$$\nb_{1}=\\bullet \\quad=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}=V\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nb_{2}=\\bullet-\\bullet=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{2} f\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThere are four diagrams contributing to $b_{3}$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nb_{3}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{2} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{3}\\left[f\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right) f\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{3}\\right)+f\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{3}\\right) f\\left(\\vec{q}_{3}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right)+f\\left(\\vec{q}_{3}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\right.\\right. \\\\\n\\left.+f\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right) f\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{3}\\right) f\\left(\\vec{q}_{3}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nA given $N$ -particle graph can be decomposed to $n_{1}$ 1-clusters, $n_{2}$ 2-clusters, $\\cdots, n_{\\ell} \\ell$ clusters, etc. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{N}=\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}^{\\prime}} \\prod_{\\ell} b_{\\ell}^{n_{\\ell}} W\\left(\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the restricted sum is over all distinct divisions of $N$ points into a set of clusters $\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}$, such that $\\sum_{\\ell} \\ln _{\\ell}=N .$ The coefficients $W\\left(\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}\\right)$ are the number of ways of assigning $N$ particle labels to groups of $n_{\\ell} \\ell$ -clusters. For example, the divisions of 3 particles into a 1-cluster and a 2-cluster are\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c952bf7240094200e653c03bc840021d-2.jpg?height=86&width=620&top_left_y=1196&top_left_x=326)\n\nAll above graphs have $n_{1}=1$ and $n_{2}=1$, and contribute a factor of $b_{1} b_{2}$ to $S_{3} ;$ thus $W(1,1)=3$\n\nIn general, $W\\left(\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}\\right)$ is the number of distinct ways of grouping the labels $1, \\ldots, N$ into bins of $n_{\\ell} \\ell$ -clusters. It can be obtained from the total number of permutations, $N !$, after dividing by the number of equivalent assignments. Within each bin of $\\ell n_{\\ell}$ particles, equivalent assignments are obtained by: (i) permuting the $\\ell$ labels in each subgroup in $\\ell !$ ways, for a total of $(\\ell !)^{n_{\\ell}}$ permutations; and (ii) the $n_{\\ell} !$ rearrangements of the $n_{\\ell}$ subgroups. Hence,\n\n$$\nW\\left(\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}\\right)=\\frac{N !}{\\prod_{\\ell} n_{\\ell} !(\\ell !)^{n_{\\ell}}}\n$$\n\n(We can indeed check that $W(1,1)=3 ! /(1 !)(2 !)=3$ as obtained above.)\n\nUsing the above value of $W$, the expression for $\\mathcal{S}_{N}$ in eq.(V.21) can be evaluated. However, the restriction of the sum to configurations such that $\\sum_{\\ell} \\ell n_{\\ell}=N$ complicates the evaluation. Fortunately, this restriction disappears in the expression for the grand partition function in eq.(V.16),\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{N !}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{N} \\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}^{\\prime}} \\frac{N !}{\\prod_{\\ell} n_{\\ell} !(\\ell !)^{n_{\\ell}}} \\prod_{\\ell} b_{\\ell}^{n_{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nThe restriction in the second sum is now removed by noting that $\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}} \\delta \\sum_{\\ell} \\ell_{n_{\\ell}, N}=$ $\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}} .$ Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Q} &=\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\sum_{\\ell} \\ell n_{\\ell}} \\prod_{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}^{n_{\\ell}}}{n_{\\ell} !(\\ell !)^{n_{\\ell}}}=\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}} \\prod_{\\ell} \\frac{1}{n_{\\ell} !}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu \\ell} b_{\\ell}}{\\lambda^{3 \\ell} \\ell !}\\right)^{n_{\\ell}} \\\\\n&=\\prod_{\\ell} \\sum_{\\left\\{n_{\\ell}\\right\\}} \\frac{1}{n_{\\ell} !}\\left[\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}}{\\ell !}\\right]^{n_{\\ell}}=\\prod_{\\ell} \\exp \\left[\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}}{\\ell !}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\exp \\left[\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}}{\\ell !}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe above result has the simple geometrical interpretation that the sum over all graphs, connected or not, equals the exponential of the sum over connected graphs. This is a quite general result that is also related to the graphical connection between moments and cumulants discussed in sec.II.B.\n\nThe grand potential is now obtained from\n\n$$\n\\ln \\mathcal{Q}=-\\beta \\mathcal{G}=\\frac{P V}{k T}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}}{l !}\n$$\n\nIn eq.(V.25), the extensivity condition is used to get $\\mathcal{G}=E-T S-\\mu N=-P V$. Thus the terms on the right hand side of the above equation must also be proportional to the volume $V$. This can be explicitly verified by noting that in evaluating each $b_{\\ell}$ there is an integral over the center of mass coordinate that explores the whole volume. For example, $b_{2}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{2} f\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)=V \\int d^{3} \\vec{q}_{12} f\\left(\\vec{q}_{12}\\right) .$ Quite generally, we can set\n\n$$\n\\lim _{V \\rightarrow \\infty} b_{\\ell}=V b_{\\ell}\n$$\n\nand the pressure is now obtained from\n\n$$\n\\frac{P}{k T}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{b_{\\ell}}{\\ell !}\n$$\n\nThe linked cluster theorem ensures $\\mathcal{G} \\propto V$, since if any non-linked cluster had appeared in $\\ln \\mathcal{Q}$, it would have contributed a higher power of $V$.\n\nAlthough an expansion for the gas pressure, eq.(V.27) is quite different from eq.(V.14) in that it involves powers of $e^{\\beta \\mu}$ rather than the density $n=N / V .$ This difference can be removed by solving for the density in terms of the chemical potential, using\n\n$$\nN=\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Q}}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\ell\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu}}{\\lambda^{3}}\\right)^{\\ell} \\frac{V b_{\\ell}}{\\ell !}\n$$\n\nThe equation of state can be obtained by eliminating the fugacity $x=e^{\\beta \\mu} / \\lambda^{3}$, between the equations\n\n$$\nn=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{(\\ell-1) !} \\bar{\\ell}_{\\ell}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{P}{k T}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{\\ell !} b_{\\ell}\n$$\n\nusing the following steps:\n\n(a) Solve for $x(n)$ from $\\left(\\bar{b}_{1}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q} / V=1\\right)$\n\n$$\nx=n-b_{2} x^{2}-\\frac{b_{3}}{2} x^{3}-\\cdots\n$$\n\nThe perturbative solution at each order is obtained by substituting the solution at the previous order in eq.(V.30),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&x_{1}=n+\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}\\right) \\\\\n&x_{2}=n-b_{2} n^{2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{3}\\right) \\\\\n&x_{3}=n-b_{2}\\left(n-b_{2} n\\right)^{2}-\\frac{b_{3}}{2} n^{3}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{4}\\right)=n-b_{2} n^{2}+\\left(2 b_{2}^{2}-\\frac{b_{3}}{2}\\right) n^{3}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{4}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) Substitute the perturbative result for $x(n)$ into eq.(V.29), yielding\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\beta P &=x+\\frac{b_{2}}{2} x^{2}+\\frac{b_{3}}{6} x^{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n&=n-b_{2} n^{2}+\\left(2 b_{2}^{2}-\\frac{5_{3}}{2}\\right) n^{3}+\\frac{b_{2}}{2} n^{2}-b_{2}^{2} n^{3}+\\frac{b_{3}}{6} n^{3}+\\cdots \\\\\n&=n-\\frac{b_{2}}{2} n^{2}+\\left(b_{2}^{2}-\\frac{b_{3}}{3}\\right) n^{3}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{4}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe final result is in the form of the virial expansion of eq.(V.14),\n\n$$\n\\beta P=n+\\sum_{\\ell=2}^{\\infty} B_{\\ell}(T) n^{\\ell}\n$$\n\nThe first term in the series reproduces the ideal gas result.

This is because the different $\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}$ are independently distributed and $\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right) \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{k}-\\vec{q}_{l}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0}$ equals $\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0}\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{k}-\\vec{q}_{l}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0}$\n\n(ii) There is one common index between the two pairs, e.g. $\\{(i, j),(i, l)\\} .$ By changing coordinates to $\\vec{q}_{i j}=\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}$ and $\\vec{q}_{i l}=\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{l}$, it again follows that $\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right) \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{l}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0}$ equals $\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0}\\left\\langle\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{l}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{0} .$ The vanishing of these terms is a consequence of the translational symmetry of the problem in the absence of an external potential. (iii) In the remaining $N(N-1) / 2$ terms the pairs are identical, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{U}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}^{0}=\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\\left[\\int \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{q}}{V} \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q})^{2}-\\left(\\int \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{q}}{V} \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q})\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe second term in the above equation is smaller by a factor of $d^{3} / V$, where $d$ is a characteristic range for the potential $\\mathcal{V} .$ For any reasonable potential that decays with distance, this term vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nSimilar groupings occur for higher order terms in this cumulant expansion. It is helpful to visualize the terms in the expansion diagrammatically as follows:\n\n(a) For a term of order $\\ell$, draw $\\ell$ pairs of points (representing $\\vec{q}_{i}$ and $\\left.\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)$ connected by bonds, representing the interaction $\\mathcal{V}_{i j} \\equiv \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right) .$ An overall factor of $1 / \\ell !$ accompanies such graphs.\n\n(b) By multiple selections of the same index $i$, two or more bonds can be joined together forming a diagram of interconnected points. There is a factor $S_{\\ell}$ associated with the number of ways of assigning labels 1 through $N$ to the different points of the graph. Ignoring the differences between $N, N-1$, etc., a diagram with $n_{s}$ points makes a contribution proportional to $N^{n_{s}}$. There is typically also division by a symmetry factor which takes into account the number of equivalent assignments. For example, the diagrams involving a pair of points, calculated in eqs.(V.9) and (V.11), have a symmetry factor of $1 / 2$.\n\n(c) Apart from these numerical prefactors, the contribution of a diagram is an integral $R_{\\ell}$ over all the $n_{s}$ coordinates $\\vec{q}_{i}$, of products of corresponding $\\mathcal{V}_{i j} .$ If the graphs has $n_{c}$ disconnected clusters, integration over the center of mass coordinates of the clusters gives a factor of $V^{n_{c}}$\n\nFortunately, many cancellations occur in calculating cumulants. In particular:\n\n- When calculating the moment $\\left\\langle U^{\\ell}\\right\\rangle^{0}$, the contribution of a disconnected diagram is simply the product of its disjoint clusters. The coordinates of these clusters are independent random variables, and make no contribution to the joint cumulant $\\left\\langle U^{\\ell}\\right\\rangle_{c}^{0}$. This result also ensures the extensivity of $\\ln Z$, as the surviving connected diagrams give a factor of $V$ from their center of mass integration. (Disconnected clusters have more factors of $V$, and are non-extensive.)\n\n- There are also one particle reducible clusters which are fully connected, yet fall to disjoint fragments if a single coordinate point is removed. By measuring all other coordinates relative to this special point, it can be seen that (in a translationally invariant system) the value of such a diagram is the product of its disjoint fragments. It can be shown that such diagrams are also cancelled out in calculating the cumulant. Thus only one particle irreducible clusters survive in this cumulant expansion. A cluster with $n_{s}$ sites and $\\ell$ bonds makes a contribution of order of $N(N / V)^{n_{s}-1}(\\beta \\mathcal{V})^{\\ell}$ to $\\ln Z$\n\nIgnoring terms of order of $1 / N$, the cumulant expansion leads to a corrected free energy,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF(T, V, N)=F_{0}(T, V, N)+& \\frac{N^{2}}{2 V}\\left(\\int d^{3} \\vec{q} \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q})-\\frac{\\beta}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q} \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q})^{2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\beta^{2} \\mathcal{V}^{3}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N^{3} \\beta^{2} \\mathcal{V}^{3}}{V^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom this expression we can proceed to calculate other modified state functions, e.g. $P=$ $-\\partial F /\\left.\\partial V\\right|_{T, N} .$ Unfortunately, the expansion in powers of $\\beta \\mathcal{V}$ is not particularly useful. The inter-atomic potential $\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{r})$ for most particles has an attractive tail due to van der Waals interactions that decays as $-1 / r^{6}$ at large separations $r=|\\vec{r}| .$ At short distances the overlap of the electron clouds makes the potential strongly repulsive. Typically there is a minimum of depth a few hundred degrees Kelvin, at a distance of a few angstroms. The infinity in $\\mathcal{V}(\\vec{r})$ at short distances makes it an unsuitable expansion parameter. This problem can be alleviated by a partial resummation of diagrams. For example, to get the correction at order of $N^{2} / V$, we need to sum over all two point clusters, independent of the number of bonds. The resulting sum is actually quite trivial, and leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ln Z &=\\ln Z_{0}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-\\beta)^{n}}{n !} \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\int \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{q}}{V} \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q})^{n}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N^{3}}{V^{2}}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\ln Z_{0}+\\frac{N(N-1)}{2 V} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q}[\\exp (-\\beta \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q}))-1]+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{N^{3}}{V^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe quantity $f(\\vec{q})=\\exp (-\\beta \\mathcal{V}(\\vec{q}))-1$ is a much more convenient expansion parameter which goes to $-1$ at short distances and rapidly vanishes for large separations. In the next section we shall recast the perturbative expansion in terms of this quantity.

The macrostates $M \\equiv(T, \\mathbf{J})$, are specified in terms of the external temperature and forces acting on the system; the thermodynamic coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ appear as additional random variables. The system is maintained at constant force through external elements (e.g. pistons or magnets). Including the work done against the forces, the energy of the combined system that includes these elements is $\\mathcal{H}-\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}$. Note that while the work done on the system is $+\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}$, the energy change associated with the external elements with coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ has the opposite sign. The microstates of this combined system occur with the (canonical) probabilities\n\n$$\np\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\mathbf{x}\\right)=\\exp \\left[-\\beta \\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)+\\beta \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}\\right] / \\mathcal{Z}(T, N, \\mathbf{J})\n$$\n\nwith the Gibbs partition function,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}(N, T, \\mathbf{J})=\\sum_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}, \\mathbf{x}} e^{\\beta \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}-\\beta \\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)}\n$$\n\n(Note that we have explicitly included the particle number $N$ to indicate that there is no chemical work. Chemical work is considered in the Grand Canonical Ensemble, which is discussed next.)\n\nIn this ensemble, the expectation value of the coordinates is obtained from\n\n$$\n\\langle\\mathbf{x}\\rangle=k_{B} T \\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}\n$$\n\nwhich together with the thermodynamic identity $\\mathbf{x}=-\\partial G / \\partial \\mathbf{J}$, suggests the identification\n\n$$\nG(N, T, \\mathbf{J})=-k_{B} T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}\n$$\n\nwhere $G=E-T S-\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$ is the Gibbs free energy. (The same conclusion can be reached by equating $\\mathcal{Z}$ in eq.(IV.86) to the term that maximizes the probability with respect to x.) The enthalpy $H \\equiv E-\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}$ is easily obtained in this ensemble from\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{\\partial \\beta}=\\langle\\mathcal{H}-\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}\\rangle=H\n$$\n\nNote that heat capacities at constant force (which include work done against the external forces), are obtained from the enthalpy as $C_{\\mathbf{J}}=\\partial H / \\partial T$. The following examples illustrate the use of the Gibbs canonical ensemble:\n\n1. The Ideal Gas in the isobaric ensemble is described by the macrostate $M \\equiv(N, T, P)$. A micro-state $\\mu \\equiv\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}$, with a volume $V$ occurs with the probability\n\n$$\np\\left(\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{i}, \\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\}, V\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Z}} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2 m}-\\beta P V\\right] \\cdot\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & \\text { for }\\left\\{\\vec{q}_{i}\\right\\} \\in \\text { box of volume } V \\\\\n0 \\quad \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe normalization factor is now\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Z}(N, T, P) &=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d V e^{-\\beta P V} \\int \\frac{1}{N !} \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i}}{h^{3}} \\exp \\left[-\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2 m}\\right] \\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d V V^{N} e^{-\\beta P V} \\frac{1}{N ! \\lambda(T)^{3 N}}=\\frac{1}{\\left(\\beta P \\lambda(T)^{3}\\right)^{N}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe Gibbs free energy is given by\n\n$$\nG=-k_{B} T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}=N k_{B} T\\left[\\ln P-\\frac{5}{2} \\ln \\left(k_{B} T\\right)+\\frac{3}{2} \\ln \\left(\\frac{h^{2}}{2 \\pi m}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nStarting from $d G=-S d T+V d P+\\mu d N$, the volume of the gas is obtained as\n\n$$\nV=\\left.\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial P}\\right|_{T, N}=\\frac{N k_{B} T}{P}, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P V=N k_{B} T\n$$\n\nThe enthalpy $H=\\langle E+P V\\rangle$ is easily calculated from\n\n$$\nH=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{\\partial \\beta}=\\frac{5}{2} N k_{B} T\n$$\n\nfrom which we get $C_{P}=d H / d T=5 / 2 N k_{B}$\n\n2. Spins in an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, provide a common example for usage of the Gibbs canonical ensemble. Adding the work done against the magnetic field to the internal Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}$, results in the Gibbs partition function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}(N, T, B)=\\operatorname{tr}[\\exp (-\\beta \\mathcal{H}+\\beta \\vec{B} \\cdot \\vec{M})]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{M}$ is the net magnetization. The symbol $\\mathrm{tr}$ is used to indicate the sum over all spin degrees of freedom, which in a quantum mechanical formulation are restricted to discrete values. The simplest case is spin of $1 / 2$, with two possible projections of the spin along the magnetic field. A microstate of $N$ spins is now described by the set of Ising variables $\\left\\{\\sigma_{i}=\\pm 1\\right\\} .$ The corresponding magnetization along the field direction is given by $M=\\mu_{0} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_{i}$, where $\\mu_{0}$ is a microscopic magnetic moment. Assuming that there are no interactions between spins $(\\mathcal{H}=0)$, the probability of a microstate is\n\n$$\np\\left(\\left\\{\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Z}} \\exp \\left[\\beta B \\mu_{0} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_{i}\\right]\n$$\n\nClearly, this is closely related to the example of two level systems discussed in the canonical ensemble, and we can easily obtain the Gibbs partition function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}(N, T, B)=\\left[2 \\cosh \\left(\\beta \\mu_{0} B\\right)\\right]^{N}\n$$\n\nand the Gibbs free energy\n\n$$\nG=-k_{B} T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}=-N k_{B} T \\ln \\left[2 \\cosh \\left(\\beta \\mu_{0} B\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe average magnetization is given by\n\n$$\nM=-\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial B}=N \\mu_{0} \\tanh \\left(\\beta \\mu_{0} B\\right)\n$$\n\nExpanding eq.(IV.97) for small $B$ results in the well-known Curie law for magnetic susceptibility of non-interacting spins,\n\n$$\n\\chi(T)=\\left.\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial B}\\right|_{B=0}=\\frac{N \\mu_{0}^{2}}{k_{B} T}\n$$\n\nThe enthalpy is simply $H=\\langle\\mathcal{H}-B M\\rangle=-B M$, and $C_{B}=-B \\partial M / \\partial T$.\n\n\\section{IV.I The Grand Canonical Ensemble}\n\nThe previous sections demonstrate that while the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are completely equivalent in the thermodynamic limit, it is frequently much easier to perform statistical mechanical computations in the canonical framework. Sometimes it is more convenient to allow chemical work (by fixing the chemical potential $\\mu$, rather than at a fixed number of particles), but no mechanical work. The resulting macro-states $M \\equiv(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})$, are governed by the grand canonical ensemble. The corresponding microstates $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}$, contain an indefinite number of particles $N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right) .$ As in the case of the canonical ensemble, the system $\\mathrm{S}$, can be maintained at a constant chemical potential through contact with a reservoir $\\mathrm{R}$, at temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu .$ The probability distribution for the micro-states of $\\mathrm{S}$ is obtained by summing over all states of the reservoir, as in eq.(IV. 53$)$, and is given by\n\n$$\np\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)=\\exp \\left[\\beta \\mu N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)-\\beta \\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)\\right] / \\mathcal{Q}\n$$\n\nThe normalization factor is the grand partition function,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}} e^{\\beta \\mu N\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)-\\beta \\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe can reorganize the above summation by grouping together all micro-states with a given number of particles, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta \\mu N} \\sum_{\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}} \\mid N\\right)} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}_{N}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe restricted sums in eq.(IV.101) are just the $N$ -particle partition functions. As each term in $\\mathcal{Q}$ is the total weight of all micro-states of $N$ particles, the unconditional probability of finding $N$ particles in the system is\n\n$$\np(N)=\\frac{e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z(T, N, \\mathbf{x})}{\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})}\n$$\n\nThe average number of particles in the system is\n\n$$\n\\langle N\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Q}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)} \\mathcal{Q}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)} \\ln \\mathcal{Q}\n$$\n\nwhile the number fluctuations are related to the variance\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle N^{2}\\right\\rangle_{C}=\\left\\langle N^{2}\\right\\rangle-\\langle N\\rangle^{2}=\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{Q}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)^{2}} \\ln \\mathcal{Q}-\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)} \\ln \\mathcal{Q}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)^{2}} \\ln \\mathcal{Q}=\\frac{\\partial\\langle N\\rangle}{\\partial(\\beta \\mu)}\n$$\n\nThe variance is thus proportional to $N$, and the relative number fluctuations vanish in the thermodynamic limit, establishing the equivalence of this ensemble to the previous ones.\n\nBecause of the sharpness of the distribution for $N$, the sum in eq.(IV.101) can be approximated by its largest term at $N=N^{*} \\approx<N>$, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{Q}(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})=& \\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{\\beta \\mu N} Z(T, N, \\mathbf{x})=e^{\\beta \\mu N^{*}} Z\\left(T, N^{*}, \\mathbf{x}\\right)=e^{\\beta \\mu N^{*}-\\beta F} \\\\\n&=e^{-\\beta\\left(-\\mu N^{*}+E-T S\\right)}=e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{G}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(T, \\mu, \\mathbf{x})=E-T S-\\mu N=-k_{B} T \\ln \\mathcal{Q}\n$$\n\nis the grand potential. Thermodynamic information is obtained by using $d \\mathcal{G}=-S d T-$ $N d \\mu+\\mathbf{J} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x}$, as\n\n$$\n-S=\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}}{\\partial T}\\right|_{\\mu, \\mathbf{x}}, \\quad N=-\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}}{\\partial \\mu}\\right|_{T, \\mathbf{x}}, \\quad \\quad J_{i}=\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}}{\\partial x_{i}}\\right|_{T, \\mu}\n$$\n\nAs a final example, we compute the properties of the ideal gas of non-interacting particles in the grand canonical ensemble. The macro-state is $M \\equiv(T, \\mu, V)$, and the corresponding micro-states $\\left\\{\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, \\cdots\\right\\}$ have indefinite particle number.

Under the transformation $(E, V, N) \\rightarrow(\\lambda E, \\lambda V, \\lambda N)$, the entropy changes to $\\lambda\\left(S+N k_{B} \\ln \\lambda\\right)$. The additional term comes from the contribution $V^{N}$, of the coordinates to the available phase space. This difficulty is intimately related to the mixing entropy of two gases. Consider two distinct gases, initially occupying volumes $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ at the same temperature $T$. The partition between them is removed, and they are allowed to expand and occupy the combined volume $V=V_{1}+V_{2} .$ The mixing process is clearly irreversible, and must be accompanied by an increase in entropy, calculated as follows. According to eq.(IV.33), the initial entropy is\n\n$$\nS_{i}=S_{1}+S_{2}=N_{1} k_{B}\\left(\\ln V_{1}+\\sigma_{1}\\right)+N_{2} k_{B}\\left(\\ln V_{2}+\\sigma_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\alpha}=\\ln \\left(\\frac{4 \\pi e m_{\\alpha}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{E_{\\alpha}}{N_{\\alpha}}\\right)^{3 / 2}\n$$\n\nis the momentum contribution to the entropy of the $\\alpha^{\\mathrm{th}}$ gas. Since $E_{\\alpha} / N_{\\alpha}=3 k_{B} T / 2$ for a monotonic gas,\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\alpha}(T)=\\frac{3}{2} \\ln \\left(2 \\pi e m_{\\alpha} k_{B} T\\right)\n$$\n\nThe temperature of the gas is unchanged by mixing, since\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T_{f}=\\frac{E_{1}+E_{2}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}=\\frac{E_{1}}{N_{1}}=\\frac{E_{2}}{N_{2}}=\\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T\n$$\n\nThe final entropy of the mixed gas is\n\n$$\nS_{f}=N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\left(V_{1}+V_{2}\\right)+N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\left(V_{1}+V_{2}\\right)+k_{B}\\left(N_{1} \\sigma_{1}+N_{2} \\sigma_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThere is no change in the contribution from the momenta which depends only on temperature. The mixing entropy,\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{Mix}}=S_{f}-S_{i}=N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V}{V_{1}}+N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V}{V_{2}}=-N k_{B}\\left[\\frac{N_{1}}{N} \\ln \\frac{V_{1}}{V}+\\frac{N_{2}}{N} \\ln \\frac{V_{2}}{V}\\right]\n$$\n\nis solely from the contribution of the coordinates. The above expression is easily generalized to the mixing of many components, with $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{Mix}}=-N k_{B} \\sum_{\\alpha}\\left(N_{\\alpha} / N\\right) \\ln \\left(V_{\\alpha} / V\\right)$.\n\nGibbs' Paradox is related to what happens when the two gases, initially on the two sides of the partition, are identical with the same density, $n=N_{1} / V_{1}=N_{2} / V_{2} .$ Since removing or inserting the partition does not change the state of the system, there should be no entropy of mixing, while eq.(IV.45) does predict such a change. For the resolution of this paradox, note that while after removing and reinserting the partition, the system does return to its initial configuration, the actual particles that occupy the two components are not the same. But as the particles are by assumption identical, these configurations cannot be distinguished. In other words, while the exchange of distinct particles leads to two configurations\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/4076ae3326a79790e1b6e6a3d54bd8d5-04.jpg?height=74&width=311&top_left_y=941&top_left_x=482)\n\na similar exchange has no effect on identical particles, as in\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\bullet \\mid}{A \\mid B} \\text { and } \\frac{\\bullet \\mid \\bullet}{A} \\mid \\frac{\\bullet}{B}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have over-counted the phase space associated with $N$ identical particles by the number of possible permutations. As there are $N !$ permutations leading to indistinguishable micro-states, eq.(IV.32) should be corrected to\n\n$$\n\\Omega(N, E, V)=\\frac{V^{N}}{N !} \\frac{2 \\pi^{3 N / 2}}{(3 N / 2-1) !}(2 m E)^{(3 N-1) / 2} \\Delta_{R}\n$$\n\nresulting in a modified entropy,\n\n$$\nS=k_{B} \\ln \\Omega=k_{B}[N \\ln V-N \\ln N+N \\ln e]+N k_{B} \\sigma=N k_{B}\\left[\\ln \\frac{e V}{N}+\\sigma\\right]\n$$\n\nAs the argument of the logarithm has changed from $V$ to $V / N$, the final expression is now properly extensive. The mixing entropies can be recalculated using eq.(IV.47). For the mixing of distinct gases,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{Mix}}=S_{f}-S_{i} &=N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V}{N_{1}}+N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V}{N_{2}}-N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V_{1}}{N_{1}}-N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V_{2}}{N_{2}} \\\\\n&=N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\left(\\frac{V}{N_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{N_{1}}{V_{1}}\\right)+N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\left(\\frac{V}{N_{2}} \\cdot \\frac{N_{2}}{V_{2}}\\right) \\\\\n&=-N k_{B}\\left[\\frac{N_{1}}{N} \\ln \\frac{V_{1}}{V}+\\frac{N_{2}}{N} \\ln \\frac{V_{2}}{V}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nexactly as obtained before in eq.(IV.45). For the 'mixing' of two identical gases, with $N_{1} / V_{1}=N_{2} / V_{2}=\\left(N_{1}+N_{2}\\right) /\\left(V_{1}+V_{2}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{Mix}}=S_{f}-S_{i}=\\left(N_{1}+N_{2}\\right) k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V_{1}+V_{2}}{N_{1}+N_{2}}-N_{1} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V_{1}}{N_{1}}-N_{2} k_{B} \\ln \\frac{V_{2}}{N_{2}}=0\n$$\n\nNote that after taking the permutations of identical particles into account, the available volume in the final state is $V^{N_{1}+N_{2}} / N_{1} ! N_{2} !$ for distinct particles, and $V^{N_{1}+N_{2}} /\\left(N_{1}+N_{2}\\right) !$ for identical particles.\n\n- Additional comments on the microcanonical entropy:\n\n1. In the example of two-level impurities in a solid matrix (sec.IV.C), there is no need for the additional factor of $N !$, as the defects can be distinguished by their locations.\n\n2. The corrected formula for the ideal gas entropy in eq.(IV.47) does not affect the computations of energy and pressure in eqs.(IV.34) and (IV.35). It is essential to obtaining an intensive chemical potential,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu}{T}=-\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial N}\\right|_{E, V}=-\\frac{S}{N}+\\frac{5}{2} k_{B}=k_{B} \\ln \\left[\\frac{V}{N}\\left(\\frac{4 \\pi m E}{3 N}\\right)^{3 / 2}\\right]\n$$\n\n3. The above treatment of identical particles is somewhat artificial. This is because the concept of identical particles does not easily fit within the framework of classical mechanics. To implement the Hamiltonian equations of motion on a computer, one has to keep track of the coordinates of the $N$ particles. The computer will have no difficulty in distinguishing exchanged particles. The indistinguishability of their phase spaces is in a sense an additional postulate of classical statistical mechanics. This problem is elegantly resolved within the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Description of identical particles in quantum mechanics requires proper symmetrization of the wave function. The corresponding quantum microstates naturally yield the $N !$ factor, as will be shown later on.\n\n4. Yet another difficulty with the expression (IV.47), resolved in quantum statistical mechanics, is the arbitrary constant that appears in changing the units of measurement for $q$ and $p$. The volume of phase space involves products $p q$, of coordinates and conjugate momenta, and hence has dimensions of (action) $^{N}$. Quantum mechanics provides the appropriate measure of action in Planck's constant $h .$ Anticipating these quantum results, we shall henceforth set the measure of phase space for identical particles to\n\n$$\nd \\Gamma_{N}=\\frac{1}{h^{3 N} N !} \\prod_{i=1}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i}\n$$\n\n\\section{IV.F The Canonical Ensemble}\n\nIn the microcanonical ensemble, the energy $E$, of a large macroscopic system is precisely specified, and its equilibrium temperature $T$, emerges as a consequence (eq.(IV.7)). However, from a thermodynamic perspective, $E$ and $T$ are both functions of state and on the same footing. It is possible to construct a statistical mechanical formulation in which the temperature of the system is specified and its internal energy is then deduced. This is achieved in the canonical ensemble where the macro-states, specified by $M \\equiv(T, \\mathbf{x})$, allow the input of heat into the system, but no external work. The system $S$, is maintained at a constant temperature through contact with a reservoir $\\mathrm{R}$. The reservoir is another macroscopic system that is sufficiently large so that its temperature is not changed due to interactions with S. To find the probabilities $p_{(T, \\mathbf{x})}(\\mu)$, of the various micro-states of S, note that the combined system $R \\oplus S$, belongs to a microcanonical ensemble of energy $E_{\\mathrm{Tot}} \\gg E_{S} .$ As in eq.(IV.3), the joint probability of micro-states $\\left(\\mu_{S} \\otimes \\mu_{R}\\right)$ is\n\n$$\np\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}} \\otimes \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{S} \\oplus \\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}\\right)} \\cdot\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\quad \\text { for } \\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)+\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)=E_{\\mathrm{Tot}} \\\\\n0 \\quad \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe unconditional probability for micro-states of $\\mathrm{S}$ is now obtained from\n\n$$\np\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)=\\sum_{\\left\\{\\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right\\}} p\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}} \\otimes \\mu_{\\mathrm{R}}\\right)\n$$\n\nOnce $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}$ is specified, the above sum is restricted to micro-states of the reservoir with energy $E_{\\text {Tot }}-\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right) .$ The number of the such states is related to the entropy of the reservoir, and leads to\n\n$$\np\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}-\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)\\right)}{\\Omega_{\\mathrm{S} \\oplus \\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}\\right)} \\propto \\exp \\left[\\frac{1}{k_{B}} S_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}-\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nSince by assumption the energy of the system is insignificant compared to that of the reservoir,\n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}-\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)\\right) \\approx S_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}\\right)-\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\partial E_{\\mathrm{R}}}=S_{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(E_{\\mathrm{Tot}}\\right)-\\frac{\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\left(\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}\\right)}{T}\n$$\n\nDropping the subscript $\\mathrm{S}$, the normalized probabilities are given by\n\n$$\np_{(T, \\mathbf{x})}(\\mu)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)}}{Z(T, \\mathbf{x})}\n$$\n\nThe normalization,\n\n$$\nZ(T, \\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{\\{\\mu\\}} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)}\n$$\n\nis known as the partition function, and $\\beta \\equiv 1 / k_{B} T$. (Note that probabilities similar to eq.(IV.56) were already obtained in eqs.(IV.25), and (IV.39), when considering a portion of the system in equilibrium with the rest of it.)\n\nIs the internal energy $E$, of the system $\\mathrm{S}$ well defined? Unlike in a microcanonical ensemble, the energy of a system exchanging heat with a reservoir is a random variable. Its probability distribution $p(\\mathcal{E})$, is obtained by changing variables from $\\mu$ to $\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)$ in $p(\\mu)$, resulting in\n\n$$\np(\\mathcal{E})=\\sum_{\\{\\mu\\}} p(\\mu) \\delta(\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)-\\mathcal{E})=\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{E}}}{Z} \\sum_{\\{\\mu\\}} \\delta(\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)-\\mathcal{E})\n$$\n\nSince the restricted sum is just the number $\\Omega(\\mathcal{E})$, of micro-states of appropriate energy,\n\n$$\np(\\mathcal{E})=\\frac{\\Omega(\\mathcal{E}) e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{E}}}{Z}=\\frac{1}{Z} \\exp \\left[\\frac{S(\\mathcal{E})}{k_{B}}-\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{k_{B} T}\\right]=\\frac{1}{Z} \\exp \\left[-\\frac{F(\\mathcal{E})}{k_{B} T}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere we have set $F=\\mathcal{E}-T S(\\mathcal{E})$, in anticipation of its relation to the Helmholtz free energy. The probability $p(\\mathcal{E})$, is sharply peaked at a most probable energy $E^{*}$, which minimizes $F(\\mathcal{E})$. Using the result in sec.(II.F) for sums over exponentials,\n\n$$\nZ=\\sum_{\\{\\mu\\}} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)}=\\sum_{\\mathcal{E}} e^{-\\beta F(\\mathcal{E})} \\approx e^{-\\beta F\\left(E^{*}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe average energy computed from the distribution in eq.(IV.59) is\n\n$$\n\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle=\\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H}(\\mu) \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)}}{Z}=-\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\sum_{\\mu} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\n\nIn thermodynamics, a similar expression was encountered for the energy (eq.(I.37)),\n\n$$\nE=F+T S=F-\\left.T \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}}=-T^{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{F}{T}\\right)=\\frac{\\partial(\\beta F)}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\n\nEqs.(IV.60) and (IV.61), both suggest identifying\n\n$$\nF(T, \\mathbf{x})=-k_{B} T \\ln Z(T, \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n\nHowever, note that eq.(IV.60) refers to the most likely energy, while the average energy appears in eq.(IV.61). How close are these two values of the energy? We can get an idea of the width of the probability distribution $p(\\mathcal{E})$, by computing the variance $\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c} .$ This is most easily accomplished by noting that $Z(\\beta)$ is proportional to the characteristic function for $\\mathcal{H}$ (with $\\beta$ replacing $i k$ ) and,\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta}=\\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{\\partial^{2} Z}{\\partial \\beta^{2}}=\\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H}^{2} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}\n$$\n\nCumulants of $\\mathcal{H}$ are generated by $\\ln Z(\\beta)$,\n\n$$\n\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle_{c}=\\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}=-\\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial \\beta}=-\\frac{\\partial \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}=\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle-\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle^{2}=\\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H}^{2} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}-\\frac{1}{Z^{2}}\\left(\\sum_{\\mu} \\mathcal{H} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta^{2}}=-\\frac{\\partial\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle}{\\partial \\beta}\n$$\n\nMore generally, the $n^{\\text {th }}$ cumulant of $\\mathcal{H}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{n}\\right\\rangle_{c}=(-1)^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{n} \\ln Z}{\\partial \\beta^{n}}\n$$\n\nFrom eq.(IV.66),\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}=-\\frac{\\partial\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle}{\\partial\\left(1 / k_{B} T\\right)}=\\left.k_{B} T^{2} \\frac{\\partial\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle}{\\partial T}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}}, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}=k_{B} T^{2} C_{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n\nwhere we have identified the heat capacity with the thermal derivative of the average energy $\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle$. Eq.(IV.68) shows that it is justified to treat the mean and most likely energies interchangeably, since the width of the distribution $p(\\mathcal{E})$, only grows as $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}} \\propto N^{1 / 2}$ The relative error, $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{c}} /\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle_{c}$ vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as $1 / \\sqrt{N}$. (In fact eq.(IV.67) shows that all cumulants of $\\mathcal{H}$ are proportional to $N .)$ The PDF for energy in a canonical ensemble can thus be approximated by\n\n$$\np(\\mathcal{E})=\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta F(\\mathcal{E})} \\approx \\exp \\left(-\\frac{(\\mathcal{E}-\\langle\\mathcal{H}\\rangle)^{2}}{2 k_{B} T^{2} C_{\\mathbf{x}}}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi k_{B} T^{2} C_{\\mathbf{x}}}}\n$$\n\nThe above distribution is sufficiently sharp to make the internal energy in a canonical ensemble unambiguous in the $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit. Some care is necessary if the heat capacity $C_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is divergent, as is the case in some continuous phase transitions.\n\nThe canonical probabilities in eq.(IV.56) are unbiased estimates obtained (as in sec.(II.G)) by constraining the average energy. The entropy of the canonical ensemble can also be calculated directly from eq.(IV.56) (using eq.(III.68)) as\n\n$$\nS=-k_{B}\\langle\\ln p(\\mu)\\rangle=-k_{B}\\langle(-\\beta \\mathcal{H}-\\ln Z)\\rangle=\\frac{E-F}{T}\n$$\n\nagain using the identification of $\\ln Z$ with the free energy from eq.(IV.63). For any finite system, the canonical and microcanonical probabilities are distinct. However, in the so called thermodynamic limit of $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit, the canonical probabilities are so sharply peaked around the average energy that they are essentially indistinct from microcanonical probabilities at that energy. The following table compares the prescriptions used in the two ensembles.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline Ensemble & Macro-state & $p(\\mu)$ & Normalization \\\\\n\\hline \\hline Microcanonical & $(E, \\mathbf{x})$ & $\\delta_{\\Delta}(\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)-E) / \\Omega$ & $S(E, \\mathbf{x})=k_{B} \\ln \\Omega$ \\\\\n\\hline Canonical & $(T, \\mathbf{x})$ & $\\exp (-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)) / Z$ & $F(T, \\mathbf{x})=-k_{B} T \\ln Z$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nTable 3: Comparison of canonical and microcanonical ensembles.

Classical Statistical Mechanics\n}\n\n\\section{IV.A General Definitions}\n\n- Statistical Mechanics is a probabilistic approach to equilibrium macroscopic properties of large numbers of degrees of freedom.\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nAs discussed in chapter I, equilibrium properties of macroscopic bodies are phenomenologically described by the laws of thermodynamics. The macro-state $M$, depends on a relatively small number of thermodynamic coordinates. To provide a more fundamental derivation of these properties, we can examine the dynamics of the many degrees of freedom $N$, comprising a macroscopic body. Description of each micro-state $\\mu$, requires an enormous amount of information, and the corresponding time evolution, governed by the Hamiltonian equations (discussed in chapter II), is usually quite complicated. Rather than following the evolution of an individual (pure) micro-state, statistical mechanics examines an ensemble of micro-states corresponding to a given (mixed) macro-state. It aims to provide the probabilities $p_{M}(\\mu)$, for the equilibrium ensemble. Liouville's theorem justifies the assumption that all accessible micro-states are equally likely in an equilibrium ensemble. As discussed in chapter III, such assignment of probabilities is subjective. In this chapter we shall provide unbiased estimates of $p_{M}(\\mu)$ for a number of different equilibrium ensembles. A central conclusion is that in the thermodynamic limit of large $N$ all these ensembles are in fact equivalent. In contrast to kinetic theory, equilibrium statistical mechanics leaves out the question of how various systems achieve equilibrium.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{IV.B The Microcanonical Ensemble}\n\nOur starting point in thermodynamics is a mechanically and adiabatically isolated system. In the absence of heat or work input to the system, the internal energy $E$, and the generalized coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$, are fixed, specifying a macro-state $M \\equiv(E, \\mathbf{x}) .$ The corresponding set of mixed micro-states form the microcanonical ensemble. In classical statistical mechanics, these microstates are defined by points in phase space, their time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)$, as discussed in Chapter II. Since the Hamiltonian equations (II.1) conserve the total energy of a given system, all micro-states are confined to the surface $\\mathcal{H}(\\mu)=E$ in phase space. Assume that there are no other conserved quantities, so that all points on this surface are mutually accessible. The central postulate of statistical mechanics is that the equilibrium probability distribution is given by\n\n$$\np_{(E, \\mathbf{x})}(\\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega(E, \\mathbf{x})} \\cdot \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { for } \\mathcal{H}(\\mu)=E \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSome remarks and clarification on the above postulate are in order:\n\n(1) Boltzmann's assumption of equal a priori equilibrium probabilities refers to the above postulate, which is in fact the unbiased probability estimate in phase space subject to the constraint of constant energy. This assignment is consistent with, but not required by, Liouville's theorem. Note that the phase space, specifying the microstates $\\mu$, must be composed of canonically conjugate pairs. Under a canonical change of variables, $\\mu \\rightarrow \\mu^{\\prime}$, volumes in phase space are left invariant. The Jacobian of such transformations is unity, and the transformed probability, $p\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)=p(\\mu)\\left|\\partial \\mu / \\partial \\mu^{\\prime}\\right|$, is again uniform on the surface of constant energy.\n\n(2) The normalization factor $\\Omega(E, \\mathbf{x})$, is the area of the surface of constant energy $E$ in phase space. To avoid subtleties associated with densities that are non-zero only a surface, is sometimes more convenient to define the microcanonical ensemble by requiring $E-\\Delta \\leq \\mathcal{H}(\\mu) \\leq E+\\Delta$, i.e. assigning the energy of the ensemble up to an uncertainty of $\\Delta .$ In this case, the accessible phase space forms a shell of thickness $\\Delta$ around the surface of energy $E .$ The normalization is now the volume of the shell, $\\Omega^{\\prime} \\approx 2 \\Delta \\Omega .$ Since $\\Omega$ typically depends exponentially on $E$, as long as $\\Delta \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(E^{0}\\right)$ (or even $\\left.\\mathcal{O}\\left(E^{1}\\right)\\right)$, the difference between the surface and volume of the shell is negligible in the $E \\propto N \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit, and we shall use $\\Omega$ and $\\Omega^{\\prime}$ interchangeably.\n\n(3) The entropy of this uniform probability distribution is given by\n\n$$\nS(E, \\mathbf{x})=k_{B} \\ln \\Omega(E, \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n\nAn additional factor of $k_{B}$ is introduced compared to the definition of eq.(III.68), so that the entropy has the correct dimensions of energy per degrees Kelvin, used in thermodynamics. $\\Omega$ and $S$ are not changed by a canonical change of coordinates in phase space. For a collection of independent systems, the overall allowed phase space is the product of individual ones, i.e. $\\Omega_{\\text {Total }}=\\prod_{i} \\Omega_{i} .$ The resulting entropy is thus additive, as expected for an extensive quantity.\n\nVarious results in thermodynamics now follow from eq.(IV.1), provided that we consider macroscopic systems with many degrees of freedom. - The Zeroth law: Equilibrium properties are discussed in thermodynamics by placing two previously isolated systems in contact, and allowing them to exchange heat. We can similarly bring together two microcanonical systems, and allowing them to exchange energy, but not work. If the original systems have energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ respectively, the combined system has energy $E=E_{1}+E_{2} .$ Assuming that interactions between the two parts are small, each micro-state of the joint system corresponds to a pair of micro-states of the two components, i.e. $\\mu=\\mu_{1} \\otimes \\mu_{2}$, and $\\mathcal{H}\\left(\\mu_{1} \\otimes \\mu_{2}\\right)=\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\left(\\mu_{1}\\right)+\\mathcal{H}_{2}\\left(\\mu_{2}\\right) .$ As the joint system is in a microcanonical ensemble of energy $E=E_{1}+E_{2}$, in equilibrium\n\n$$\np_{E}\\left(\\mu_{1} \\otimes \\mu_{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega(E)} \\cdot \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { for } \\mathcal{H}_{1}\\left(\\mu_{1}\\right)+\\mathcal{H}_{2}\\left(\\mu_{2}\\right)=E \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince only the overall energy is fixed, the total allowed phase space is computed from\n\n$$\n\\Omega(E)=\\int d E_{1} \\Omega_{1}\\left(E_{1}\\right) \\Omega_{2}\\left(E-E_{1}\\right)=\\int d E_{1} \\exp \\left[\\frac{S_{1}\\left(E_{1}\\right)+S_{2}\\left(E-E_{1}\\right)}{k_{B}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe properties of the two systems in the new joint equilibrium state are implicit in eq.(IV.3). We can make them explicit by examining the entropy that follows from eq.(IV.4). Extensivity of entropies suggests that $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, are proportional to the number of particles in the systems, making the integrand in eq.(IV.4) an exponentially large quantity. Hence the integral can be equated by the saddle point method to the maximum value of the integrand, obtained for energies $E_{1}^{*}$ and $E_{2}^{*}=E-E_{1}^{*}$, i.e.\n\n$$\nS(E)=k_{B} \\ln \\Omega(E) \\approx S_{1}\\left(E_{1}^{*}\\right)+S_{2}\\left(E_{2}^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe position of the maximum is obtained by extremizing the exponent in eq.(IV.4) with respect to $E_{1}$, resulting in the condition,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial E_{1}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{1}}}=\\left.\\frac{\\partial S_{2}}{\\partial E_{2}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathbf{2}}}\n$$\n\nAlthough all joint micro-states are equally likely, the above results indicate that there are an exponentially larger number of states in the vicinity of $\\left(E_{1}^{*}, E_{2}^{*}\\right)$. Originally, the joint system starts in the vicinity of the point $\\left(E_{1}, E_{2}\\right)$. After the exchange of energy takes place, the combined system explores a whole set of new micro-states. The probabilistic arguments provide no information on the dynamics of evolution amongst these microstates, or on the amount of time needed to establish equilibrium. However, once sufficient time has elapsed so that the assumption of equal a priori probabilities is again valid, the system is overwhelmingly likely to be at a state with internal energies $\\left(E_{1}^{*}, E_{2}^{*}\\right)$. At this equilibrium point, condition (IV.6) is satisfied, specifying a relation between two functions of state. These state functions are thus equivalent to empirical temperatures, and indeed, consistent with the fundamental result of thermodynamics, we have\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}}=\\frac{1}{T}\n$$\n\n- The first law: We next inquire about the variations of $S(E, \\mathbf{x})$ with $\\mathbf{x}$, by changing the coordinates by $\\delta \\mathbf{x}$. This results in doing work on the system by an amount $d W=\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{x}$, and changes the internal energy to $E+\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{x} .$ The first order change in entropy is given by\n\n$$\n\\delta S=S(E+\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}+\\delta \\mathbf{x})-S(E, \\mathbf{x})=\\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}} \\mathbf{J}+\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\\right|_{E}\\right) \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nThis change will occur spontaneously, taking the system into a more probable state, unless the quantity in brackets in zero. Using eq.(IV.7), this allows us to identify the derivatives\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial x_{i}}\\right|_{E, x_{j \\neq i}}=-\\frac{J_{i}}{T}\n$$\n\nHaving thus identified all variations of $S$, we have\n\n$$\nd S(E, \\mathbf{x})=\\frac{d E}{T}-\\frac{\\mathbf{J} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x}}{T}, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad d E=T d S+\\mathbf{J} \\cdot d \\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nallowing us to identify the heat input $d Q=T d S$.\n\n- The second law: Clearly, the above statistical definition of equilibrium rests on the presence of many degrees of freedom $N \\gg 1$, which make it exponentially unlikely in $N$, that the combined systems is found with component energies different from $\\left(E_{1}^{*}, E_{2}^{*}\\right) .$ By this construction, the equilibrium point has a larger number of accessible states than the starting point, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{1}\\left(E_{1}^{*}, \\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right) \\Omega_{2}\\left(E_{2}^{*}, \\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right) \\geq \\Omega_{1}\\left(E_{1}, \\mathbf{x}_{1}\\right) \\Omega_{2}\\left(E_{2}, \\mathbf{x}_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the process of evolving to the more likely (and more densely populated) regions, there is an irreversible loss of information, accompanied by an increase in entropy,\n\n$$\n\\delta S=S_{1}\\left(E_{1}^{*}\\right)+S_{2}\\left(E_{2}^{*}\\right)-S_{1}\\left(E_{1}\\right)-S_{2}\\left(E_{2}\\right) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nas required by the second law of thermodynamics. When the two bodies are first brought into contact, the equality in eq.(IV.6) does not hold. The change in entropy is such that\n\n$$\n\\delta S=\\left(\\left.\\frac{\\partial S_{1}}{\\partial E_{1}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{1}}-\\left.\\frac{\\partial S_{2}}{\\partial E_{2}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{2}}\\right) \\delta E_{1}=\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{1}}-\\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\right) \\delta E_{1} \\geq 0\n$$\n\ni.e. heat (energy) flows from the hotter to the colder body, as in Clausius's statement of the second law.\n\n- Stability conditions: Since the point $\\left(E_{1}^{*}, E_{2}^{*}\\right)$ is a maximum, the second derivative of $S_{1}\\left(E_{1}\\right)+S_{2}\\left(E_{2}\\right)$ must be negative at this point, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2} S_{1}}{\\partial E_{1}^{2}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{1}}+\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2} S_{2}}{\\partial E_{2}^{2}}\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{2}} \\leq 0\n$$\n\nApplying the above condition to two parts of the same system, the condition of thermal stability, $C_{\\mathbf{x}} \\geq 0$, as discussed in section (I.I), is regained. Similarly, the second order changes in eq.(IV.8) must be negative, requiring that the matrtix $\\partial^{2} S /\\left.\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}\\right|_{E}$ be positive definite.\n\n\\section{IV.C Two-Level Systems}\n\nConsider $N$ impurity atoms trapped in a solid matrix. Each impurity can be in one of two states, with energies 0 and $\\epsilon$ respectively. This example is somewhat different from the situations considered so far, in that the allowed micro-states are discrete. Liouville's theorem applies to Hamiltonian evolution in a continuous phase space. Although, there is less ambiguity in enumeration of discrete states, the dynamics that ensures that all allowed micro-states are equally accessed will remain unspecified for the moment. (An example from quantum mechanical evolution will be presented later on.)\n\nThe micro-states of the two level system are specified by the set of occupation numbers $\\left\\{n_{i}\\right\\}$, where $n_{i}=0$ or 1 depending on whether the $i^{\\text {th }}$ impurity is in its ground state or excited. The overall energy is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(\\left\\{n_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=\\epsilon \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i} \\equiv \\epsilon N_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $N_{1}$ is the total number of excited impurities. The macro-state is specified by the total energy $E$, and the number of impurities $N .$ The microcanonical probability is thus\n\n$$\np\\left(\\left\\{n_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\Omega(E, N)} \\delta_{\\epsilon \\sum_{i} n_{i}, E}\n$$\n\nAs there are $N_{1}=E / \\epsilon$ excited impurities, the normalization $\\Omega$ is the number of ways of choosing $N_{1}$ excited levels among the available $N$, and given by the binomial coefficient\n\n$$\n\\Omega(E, N)=\\frac{N !}{N_{1} !\\left(N-N_{1}\\right) !}\n$$\n\nThe entropy\n\n$$\nS(E, N)=k_{B} \\ln \\frac{N !}{N_{1} !\\left(N-N_{1}\\right) !}\n$$\n\ncan be simplified by Stirling's formula in the limit of $N_{1}, N \\gg 1$ to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(E, N) & \\approx-N k_{B}\\left[\\frac{N_{1}}{N} \\ln \\frac{N_{1}}{N}+\\frac{N-N_{1}}{N} \\ln \\frac{N-N_{1}}{N}\\right] \\\\\n&=-N k_{B}\\left[\\left(\\frac{E}{N \\epsilon}\\right) \\ln \\left(\\frac{E}{N \\epsilon}\\right)+\\left(1-\\frac{E}{N \\epsilon}\\right) \\ln \\left(1-\\frac{E}{N \\epsilon}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe equilibrium temperature can now be calculated from eq.(IV.7) as\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}=\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E}\\right|_{N}=-\\frac{k_{B}}{\\epsilon} \\ln \\left(\\frac{E}{N \\epsilon-E}\\right)\n$$\n\nAlternatively, the internal energy at a temperature $T$, is given by\n\n$$\nE(T)=\\frac{N \\epsilon}{\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)+1}\n$$\n\nThe internal energy is a monotonic function of temperature, increasing from a minimum value of 0 at $T=0$ to a maximum value of $N \\epsilon / 2$ at infinite temperature. It is, however, possible to start with energies larger than $N \\epsilon / 2$, which correspond to negative temperatures from eq.(IV.20). The origin of the negative temperature is the decrease in the number of microstates with increasing energy, the opposite of what happens in most systems. Two level systems have an upper bound on their energy, and very few microstates close to this maximal energy. Hence increased energy leads to more order in the system. However, once a negative temperature system is brought into contact with the rest of the universe (or any portion of it without an upper bound in energy), it loses its excess energy and comes to equilibrium at a positive temperature. The world of negative temperatures is quite unusual in that systems can be cooled by adding heat, and heated by removing it. There are physical examples of systems temporarily prepared at a metastable equilibrium of negative temperature in lasers, and for magnetic spins. The heat capacity of the system, given by\n\n$$\nC=\\frac{d E}{d T}=N k_{B}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)^{2} \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)\\left(\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)+1\\right)^{-2}\n$$\n\nvanishes at both low and high temperatures. The vanishing of $C$ as $\\exp \\left(-\\epsilon / k_{B} T\\right)$ at low temperatures is characteristic of all systems with an energy gap separating the ground state and lowest excited states. The vanishing of $C$ at high temperatures is a saturation effect, common to systems with a maximum in the number of states as a function of energy. In between, the heat capacity exhibits a peak at a characteristic temperature of $T_{\\epsilon} \\propto \\epsilon / k_{B}$.\n\nStatistical mechanics provides much more than just macroscopic quantities such as energy and heat capacity. Eq.(IV.16) is a complete joint probability distribution with considerable information on the micro-states. For example, the unconditional probability for exciting a particular impurity is obtained from\n\n$$\np\\left(n_{1}\\right)=\\sum_{\\left\\{n_{2}, \\cdots, n_{N}\\right\\}} p\\left(\\left\\{n_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega\\left(E-n_{1} \\epsilon, N-1\\right)}{\\Omega(E, N)}\n$$\n\nThe second equality is obtained by noting that once the energy taken by the first impurity is specified, the remaining energy must be distributed among the other $N-1$ impurities. Using eq.(IV.17),\n\n$$\np\\left(n_{1}=0\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega(E, N-1)}{\\Omega(E, N)}=\\frac{(N-1) !}{N_{1} !\\left(N-N_{1}-1\\right) !} \\cdot \\frac{N_{1} !\\left(N-N_{1}\\right) !}{N !}=1-\\frac{N_{1}}{N}\n$$\n\nand $p\\left(n_{1}=1\\right)=1-p\\left(n_{1}=0\\right)=N_{1} / N$. Using $N_{1}=E / \\epsilon$, and eq.(IV.21), the occupation probabilities at a temperature $T$ are\n\n$$\np(0)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad p(1)=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)}\n$$\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Mechanics I: Statistical Mechanics of Particles \\\\ Fall 2013}\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.\n","n":0.021}}},{"i":19,"$":{"0":{"v":"Lec11","n":1},"1":{"v":"\\section{III.H Zeroth Order Hydrodynamics}\n\nAs a first approximation, we shall assume that in local equilibrium, the density $f_{1}$ at each point in space can be represented as in eq.(III.56), i.e.\n\n$$\nf_{1}^{0}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t)=\\frac{n(\\vec{q}, t)}{\\left(2 \\pi m k_{B} T(\\vec{q}, t)\\right)^{3 / 2}} \\exp \\left[-\\frac{(\\vec{p}-m \\vec{u}(\\vec{q}, t))^{2}}{2 m k_{B} T(\\vec{q}, t)}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe choice of parameters clearly enforces $\\int d^{3} \\vec{p} f_{1}^{0}=n$, and $\\langle\\vec{p} / m\\rangle^{0}=\\vec{u}$, as required.

The zeroth order hydrodynamics thus predicts that the gas flow is adiabatic. This prevents the local equilibrium solution of eq.(III.93) from reaching a true global equilibrium form which necessitates an increase in entropy.\n\nTo demonstrate that eqs.(III.97) do not describe a satisfactory approach to equilibrium, examine the evolution of small deformations about a stationary $\\left(\\vec{u}_{0}=0\\right)$ state, in a uniform box $(\\vec{F}=0)$, by setting\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nn(\\vec{q}, t)=\\bar{n}+\\nu(\\vec{q}, t) \\\\\nT(\\vec{q}, t)=\\bar{T}+\\theta(\\vec{q}, t)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe shall next expand eqs.(III.97) to first order in the deviations $(\\nu, \\theta, \\vec{u}) .$ Note that to lowest order, $D_{t}=\\partial_{t}+O(u)$, leading to the linearized zeroth order hydrodynamic equations\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\partial_{t} \\nu=-\\bar{n} \\partial_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha} \\\\\nm \\partial_{t} u_{\\alpha}=-\\frac{k_{B} \\bar{T}}{\\bar{n}} \\partial_{\\alpha} \\nu-k_{B} \\partial_{\\alpha} \\theta \\\\\n\\partial_{t} \\theta=-\\frac{2}{3} \\bar{T} \\partial_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\n- Normal modes of the system are obtained by Fourier transformations,\n\n$$\nA(\\vec{k}, \\omega)=\\int d^{3} \\vec{q} d t \\exp [i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{q}-\\omega t)] A(\\vec{q}, t)\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ stands for any of the three fields $(\\nu, \\theta, \\vec{u}) .$ The natural vibration frequencies are solutions to the matrix equation\n\n$$\n\\omega\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\nu \\\\\nu_{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\theta\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & \\bar{n} k_{\\beta} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{k_{B} \\bar{T}}{m \\bar{n}} \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta} k_{\\beta} & 0 & \\frac{k_{B}}{m} \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta} k_{\\beta} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{2}{3} \\bar{T} k_{\\beta} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\nu \\\\\nu_{\\beta} \\\\\n\\theta\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is easy to check that this equation has the following modes, the first three with zero frequency:\n\n(a) Two modes describe shear flows in a uniform $(n=\\bar{n})$ and isothermal $(T=\\bar{T})$ fluid, in which the velocity varies along a direction normal to its orientation (e.g. $\\vec{u}=f(x, t) \\hat{y})$. In terms of Fourier modes $\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{u}_{T}(\\vec{k})=0$, indicating transverse flows that are not relaxed in this zeroth order approximation.\n\n(b) A third zero frequency mode describes a stationary fluid with uniform pressure $P=$ $n k_{B} T .$ While $n$ and $T$ may vary across space, their product is constant, insuring that the fluid will not start moving due to pressure variations. The corresponding eigenvector of eq.(III.103) is\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{e}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\bar{n} \\\\\n0 \\\\\n-\\bar{T}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\n(c) Finally, the longitudinal velocity $\\left(\\vec{u}_{\\ell} \\| \\vec{k}\\right)$ combines with density and temperature variations in eigenmodes of the form\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{l}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\bar{n}|\\vec{k}| \\\\\n\\omega(\\vec{k}) \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3} \\bar{T}|\\vec{k}|\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\omega(\\vec{k})=\\pm v_{\\ell}|\\vec{k}|\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nv_{\\ell}=\\sqrt{\\frac{5 k_{B} \\bar{T}}{3}}\n$$\n\nis the longitudinal sound velocity. Note that the density and temperature variations in this mode are adiabatic, i.e. the local entropy (proportional to $\\left.\\ln \\left(n T^{-3 / 2}\\right)\\right)$ is left unchanged.\n\nWe thus find that none of the conserved quantities relaxes to equilibrium in the zeroth order approximation. Shear flow and entropy modes persist forever, while the two sound modes have undamped oscillations. This is a deficiency of the zeroth order approximation which is removed by finding a better solution to the Boltzmann equation.\n\n\\section{III.I First Order Hydrodynamics}\n\nWhile $f_{1}^{0}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t)$ of eq.(III.93) does set the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation to zero, it is not a full solution, as the left hand side causes its form to vary. The left hand side is a linear differential operator, which using the various notations introduced in the previous sections, can be written as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}[f] \\equiv\\left[\\partial_{t}+\\frac{p_{\\alpha}}{m} \\partial_{\\alpha}+F_{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_{\\alpha}}\\right] f=\\left[D_{t}+c_{\\alpha} \\partial_{\\alpha}+\\frac{F_{\\alpha}}{m} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c_{\\alpha}}\\right] f\n$$\n\nIt is simpler to examine the effect of $\\mathcal{L}$ on $\\ln f_{1}^{0}$. which can be written as\n\n$$\n\\ln f_{1}^{0}=\\ln \\left(n T^{-3 / 2}\\right)-\\frac{m c^{2}}{2 k_{B} T}-\\frac{3}{2} \\ln \\left(2 \\pi m k_{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing the relation $\\partial\\left(c^{2} / 2\\right)=c_{\\beta} \\partial c_{\\beta}=-c_{\\beta} \\partial u_{\\beta}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}\\left[\\ln f_{1}^{0}\\right] &=D_{t} \\ln \\left(n T^{-3 / 2}\\right)+\\frac{m c^{2}}{2 k_{B} T^{2}} D_{t} T+\\frac{m}{k_{B} T} c_{\\alpha} D_{t} u_{\\alpha} \\\\\n&+c_{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} n}{n}-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} T}{T}\\right)+\\frac{m c^{2}}{2 k_{B} T^{2}} c_{\\alpha} \\partial_{\\alpha} T+\\frac{m}{k_{B} T} c_{\\alpha} c_{\\beta} \\partial_{\\alpha} u_{\\beta}-\\frac{F_{\\alpha} c_{\\alpha}}{k_{B} T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf the fields $n, T$, and $u_{\\alpha}$, satisfy the zeroth order hydrodynamic eqs.(III.97), we can simplify the above equation to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}\\left[\\ln f_{1}^{0}\\right] &=0-\\frac{m c^{2}}{3 k_{B} T} \\partial_{\\alpha} u_{\\alpha}+c_{\\alpha}\\left[\\left(\\frac{F_{\\alpha}}{k_{B} T}-\\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} n}{n}-\\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} T}{T}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} n}{n}-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{\\partial_{\\alpha} T}{T}\\right)-\\frac{F_{\\alpha}}{k_{B} T}\\right] \\\\\n&+\\frac{m c^{2}}{2 k_{B} T^{2}} c_{\\alpha} \\partial_{\\alpha} T+\\frac{m}{k_{B} T} c_{\\alpha} c_{\\beta} u_{\\alpha \\beta} \\\\\n&=\\frac{m}{k_{B} T}\\left(c_{\\alpha} c_{\\beta}-\\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}}{3} c^{2}\\right) u_{\\alpha \\beta}+\\left(\\frac{m c^{2}}{2 k_{B} T}-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) \\frac{c_{\\alpha}}{T} \\partial_{\\alpha} T\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic time scale $\\tau_{U}$ for $\\mathcal{L}$ is extrinsic, and can be made much larger than $\\tau_{\\times} .$ The zeroth order result is thus exact in the limit $\\left(\\tau_{\\times} / \\tau_{U}\\right) \\rightarrow 0 ;$ and corrections can be constructed in a perturbation series in $\\left(\\tau_{\\times} / \\tau_{U}\\right)$. To this purpose, we set $f_{1}=f_{1}^{0}(1+g)$ and linearize the collision operator as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nC\\left[f_{1}, f_{1}\\right] &=-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right| f_{1}^{0}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}^{0}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\left[g\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right)+g\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)-g\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)-g\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\equiv-f_{1}^{0}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) C_{L}[g]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile linear, the above integral operator is still difficult to manipulate in general.

While it is possible to obtain steady state solutions for the full phase space density $\\rho_{N}$, because of time reversal symmetry these solutions are not attractors of generic non-equilibrium densities. Does the unconditional one particle PDF $\\rho_{1}$, suffer the same problem? While the exact density $\\rho_{1}$ must necessarily reflect this property of $\\rho_{N}$, the $\\mathrm{H}$ -theorem proves that an approximate $\\rho_{1}$, governed by the Boltzmann equation, does in fact non-reversibly approach an equilibrium form. This theorem states that:\n\n- If $f_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t)$ satisfies the Boltzmann equation, then $d \\mathrm{H} / d t \\leq 0$, where\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}(t)=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p} d^{3} \\vec{q} f_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t) \\ln f_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t)\n$$\n\nThe function $\\mathrm{H}(t)$ is related to the information content of the one particle PDF. Up to an overall constant, the information content of $\\rho_{1}=f_{1} / N$ is given by $I\\left[\\rho_{1}\\right]=\\left\\langle\\ln \\rho_{1}\\right\\rangle$, which is clearly similar to $\\mathrm{H}(t)$.\n\nProof: The time derivative of $\\mathrm{H}$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial t}\\left(\\ln f_{1}+1\\right)=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} \\ln f_{1} \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial t}\n$$\n\nsince $\\int d V_{1} f_{1}=N \\int d \\Gamma \\rho=N$ is time independent. Using eq.(III.41), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} \\ln f_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}\\right) \\\\\n-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\sigma\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)\\right] \\ln f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere we shall interchangeably use $d^{2} \\sigma, d^{2} \\vec{b}$, or $d^{2} \\Omega|d \\sigma / d \\Omega|$ for the differential crosssection. The streaming terms in the above expression are zero, as shown through successive integrations by part,\n\n$$\n\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} \\ln f_{1} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}=-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} f_{1} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f_{1}} \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} f_{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}=0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} \\ln f_{1} \\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}=-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} f_{1} \\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f_{1}} \\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{1} f_{1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m}=0\n$$\n\nThe collision term in eq.(III.44) involves integrations over dummy variables $\\vec{p}_{1}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}$. The labels (1) and (2) can thus be exchanged without any change in the value of the integral. Averaging the resulting two expressions gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\ln \\left(f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n(The arguments, $\\vec{q}$ and $t$, of $f_{1}$ are suppressed for ease of notation.) We would now like to change the variables of integrations from the coordinates describing the initiators of the collision, $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b}\\right)$, to those of their products, $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b}^{\\prime}\\right) .$ The explicit functional forms describing this transformation are complicated because of the dependence of the solid angle $\\hat{\\Omega}$ in eq.(III.39) on $\\vec{b}$ and $\\left|\\vec{p}_{2}-\\vec{p}_{1}\\right| .$ However, we are assured that the Jacobian of the transformation is unity because of time reversal symmetry; since for every collision there is an inverse one obtained by reversing the momenta of the products. In terms of the new coordinates\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime} d^{2} \\vec{b}^{\\prime}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\ln \\left(f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we should now regard $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}\\right)$ in the above equation, as functions of the integration variables $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b}^{\\prime}\\right)$ as in eq.(III.39). As noted earlier, $\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}^{\\prime}-\\vec{v}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right|$ for any elastic collision, and we can use these quantities interchangeably. Finally, we relabel the dummy integration variables such that the primes are removed. Noting that the functional dependence of $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b}\\right)$ on $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is exactly the same as its inverse, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\right] \\ln \\left(f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nAveraging eqs.(III.45) and (III.47) results in\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t}=-\\frac{1}{4} \\int d^{3} \\vec{q} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{1} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\left[\\ln \\left(f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\right)-\\ln \\left(f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe integrand of the above expression is always positive. If $f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)>f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$ both terms in square brackets are positive, while both are negative if $f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)<$ $f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right) .$ In either case, their product is positive. The positivity of the integrand establishes the validity of the H-theorem,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathrm{H}}{d t} \\leq 0\n$$\n\n- Irreversibility: The second law is an empirical formulation of the vast number of everyday observations which support the existence of an arrow of time. Reconciling the reversibility of laws of physics governing the microscopic domain with the observed irreversibility of macroscopic phenomena is a fundamental problem. Of course, not all microscopic laws of physics are reversible: weak nuclear interactions violate time reversal symmetry, and the collapse of the quantum wave-function in the act of observation is irreversible. The former interactions in fact do not play any significant role in everyday observations that lead to the second law. The irreversible collapse of the wave-function may itself be an artifact of treating macroscopic observers and microscopic observables distinctly. $^{\\dagger}$ There are proponents of the view that the reversibility of the currently accepted microscopic equations of motion (classical or quantum) is indicative of their inadequacy. However, the advent of powerful computers has made it possible to simulate the evolution of collections of large numbers of particles, governed by classical, reversible equations of motion. Although simulations are currently limited to relatively small numbers of particles $\\left(10^{6}\\right)$, they do exhibit the irreversible macroscopic behaviors similar to those observed in nature (typically involving $10^{23}$ particles). For example, particles initially occupying one half of a box proceed to irreversibly, and uniformly, occupy the whole box. (This has nothing to do with limitations of computational accuracy; the same macroscopic irreversibility is observed in exactly reversible integer based simulations, such as with cellular automata.) Thus the origin of the observed irreversibilities should be sought in the classical evolution of large collections of particles.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is the first formula we have encountered that is clearly not time reversible, as indicated by eq.(III.49). We can thus ask the question of how we obtained this result from the Hamiltonian equations of motion. The key to this, of course, resides in the physically motivated approximations used to obtain eq.(III.41). The first steps of the approximation were dropping the three body collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.30), and the implicit coarse-graining of the resolution in the spatial and temporal scales. Neither of these steps explicitly violates time reversal symmetry, and the collision term in eq.(III.37) retains this property. The next step in getting to eq.(III.41) is to replace the two-body density $f_{2}(-)$, evaluated before the collision, with the product of two one body densities according to eq.(III.32). This treats the two body densities before\n\n$\\dagger$ The time dependent Schrödinger equation is fully time reversible. If it is possible to write a complicated wave-function that includes the observing apparatus (possibly the whole universe), it is hard to see how any irreversibility may occur. and after the collision differently. We could have alternatively expressed eq.(III.37) in terms of the two body densities $f_{2}(+)$ evaluated after the collision. Replacing $f_{2}(+)$ with the product of two one particle densities would then lead to the opposite conclusion, with $d \\mathrm{H} / d t \\geq 0 !$ For a system in equilibrium, it is hard to justify one choice over the other. However, once the system is out of equilibrium, the coordinates after the collision are more quite likely to be correlated, and hence the substitution of eq.(III.32) for $f_{2}(+)$ does not make sense. Time reversal symmetry implies that there should also be subtle correlations in $f_{2}(-)$ which are ignored in the so-called assumption of molecular chaos.\n\nWhile the assumption of molecular chaos before (but not after) collisions is the key to the irreversibility of the Boltzmann equation, the resulting loss of information is best justified in terms of the coarse graining of space and time: The Liouville equation and its descendants contain precise information about the evolution of a pure state. This information, however, is inevitably transported to shorter scales. A useful image is that of mixing two immiscible fluids. While the two fluids remain distinct at each point, the transitions in space from one to the next occur at finer resolution on subsequent mixing. At some point, a finite resolution in any measuring apparatus will prevent keeping track of the two components. In the Boltzmann equation the precise information of the pure state is lost at the scale of collisions. The resulting one body density only describes space and time resolutions longer than those of a two-body collision, becoming more and more probabilistic as further information is lost.\n\n\\section{III.F Equilibrium Properties}\n\nWhat is the nature of the equilibrium state described by $f_{1}$, for a homogeneous gas? (1) The equilibrium distribution: After the gas has reached equilibrium, the function $\\mathrm{H}$ should no longer decrease with time. Since the integrand in eq.(III.48) is always positive, a necessary condition for $d \\mathrm{H} / d t=0$ is that\n\n$$\nf_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)=0\n$$\n\ni.e. at each point $\\vec{q}$, we must have\n\n$$\n\\ln f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}\\right)+\\ln f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}\\right)=\\ln f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}\\right)+\\ln f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe left hand side of the above equation refers to the momenta before a two-body collision, and the right hand side to the those after the collision. The equality is thus satisfied by any additive quantity that is conserved during the collision. There are 5 such conserved quantities for an elastic collision: the particle number, the three components of the net momentum, and the kinetic energy. Hence, a general solution for $f_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\ln f_{1}=a(\\vec{q})-\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{q}) \\cdot \\vec{p}-\\beta(\\vec{q})\\left(\\frac{\\vec{p}^{2}}{2 m}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can easily accomodate the potential energy $U(\\vec{q})$ in the above form, and set\n\n$$\nf_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q})=\\mathcal{N}(\\vec{q}) \\exp \\left[-\\vec{\\alpha}(\\vec{q}) \\cdot \\vec{p}-\\beta(\\vec{q})\\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2 m}+U(\\vec{q})\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nWe shall refer to the above distribution as describing local equilibrium. While this form is preserved during collisions, it will evolve in time away from collisions, due to the streaming terms, unless $\\left\\{\\mathcal{H}_{1}, f_{1}\\right\\}=0 .$ The latter condition is satisfied for any function $f_{1}$ that depends only on $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$, or any other quantity that is conserved by it. Clearly, the above density satisfies this requirement as long as $\\mathcal{N}$, and $\\beta$ are independent of $\\vec{q}$, and $\\vec{\\alpha}=0$.\n\nAccording to eq.(III.16), the appropriate normalization for $f_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\int d^{3} \\vec{p} d^{3} \\vec{q} f_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q})=N\n$$\n\nFor particles in a box of volume $V$, the potential $U(\\vec{q})$ is zero inside the box, and infinite on the outside. The normalization factor in eq.(III.53) can be obtained from eq.(III.54) as\n\n$$\nN=\\mathcal{N} V\\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d p_{i} \\exp \\left(-\\alpha_{i} p_{i}-\\frac{\\beta p_{i}^{2}}{2 m}\\right)\\right]^{3}=\\mathcal{N} V\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m}{\\beta}\\right)^{3 / 2} \\exp \\left(\\frac{m \\alpha^{2}}{2 \\beta}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence, the properly normalized Gaussian distribution for momenta is\n\n$$\nf_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q})=n\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2 \\pi m}\\right)^{3 / 2} \\exp \\left[-\\frac{\\beta\\left(\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_{0}\\right)^{2}}{2 m}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{p}_{0}=\\langle\\vec{p}\\rangle=m \\vec{\\alpha} / \\beta$ is the mean value for the momentum of the gas, which is zero for a stationary box, and $n=N / V$ is the particle density. From the Gaussian form of the distribution it can be easily concluded that the variance of each component of the momentum is $\\left\\langle p_{i}^{2}\\right\\rangle=m / \\beta$, and\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle p^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{3 m}{\\beta}\n$$\n\n(2) Equilibrium between two gases: Consider two different gases (a) and (b), moving in the same potential $U$, and subject to a two-body interaction $\\mathcal{V}_{a b}\\left(\\vec{q}^{(a)}-\\vec{q}^{(b)}\\right) .$ We can define one-particle densities, $f_{1}^{(a)}$, and, $f_{1}^{(b)}$, for the two gases respectively. In terms of a generalized collision integral\n\n$C_{\\alpha, \\beta}=-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\Omega\\left|\\frac{d \\sigma_{\\alpha, \\beta}}{d \\Omega}\\right|\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}^{(\\alpha)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}^{(\\beta)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)-f_{1}^{(\\alpha)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right) f_{1}^{(\\beta)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)\\right]$\n\nthe evolution of these densities is governed by a simple generalization of the Boltzmann equation to\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{\\partial f_{1}^{(a)}}{\\partial t}=-\\left\\{f_{1}^{(a)}, \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(a)}\\right\\}+C_{a, a}+C_{a, b} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_{1}^{(b)}}{\\partial t}=-\\left\\{f_{1}^{(b)}, \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(b)}\\right\\}+C_{b, a}+C_{b, b}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nStationary distributions can be obtained if all six terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.59) are zero. In the absence of inter-species collisions, i.e. for $C_{a, b}=C_{b, a}$, we can obtain independent stationary distributions $f_{1}^{(a)} \\propto \\exp \\left(-\\beta_{a} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(a)}\\right)$ and $f_{1}^{(b)} \\propto \\exp \\left(-\\beta_{b} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(b)}\\right)$ Requiring the vanishing of $C_{a, b}$ leads to the additional constraint,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf_{1}^{(a)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}^{(b)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)-f_{1}^{(a)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}^{(b)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)=0, \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\\\\n\\beta_{a} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(a)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right)+\\beta_{b} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(b)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)=\\beta_{a} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(a)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)+\\beta_{b} \\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(b)}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSince the total energy $\\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(a)}+\\mathcal{H}_{1}^{(b)}$ is conserved in a collision, the above equation can be satisfied for $\\beta_{a}=\\beta_{b}=\\beta .$ From eq.(III.57) this condition implies the equality of the kinetic energies of the two species,\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\frac{p_{a}^{2}}{2 m_{a}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\frac{p_{b}^{2}}{2 m_{b}}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{3}{2 \\beta}\n$$\n\nThe parameter $\\beta$ thus plays the role of an empirical temperature describing the equilibrium of gases.\n\n(3) The equation of state: To complete the identification of $\\beta$ with temperature $T$, consider a gas of $N$ particles confined to a box of volume $V$. The gas pressure results from the force exerted by the particles colliding with the walls of the container. Consider a wall element of area $A$ perpendicular to the $x$ direction. The number of particles impacting this area, with momenta in the interval $[\\vec{p}, \\vec{p}+d \\vec{p}]$, over a time period $\\delta t$, is\n\n$$\nd \\mathcal{N}(\\vec{p})=\\left(f_{1}(\\vec{p}) d^{3} \\vec{p}\\right)\\left(A v_{x} \\delta t\\right)\n$$\n\nThe final factor in the above expression is the volume of a cylinder of height $v_{x} \\delta t$ perpendicular to the area element $A$. Only particles within this cylinder are close enough to impact the wall during $\\delta t$. As each collision imparts a momentum $2 p_{x}$ to the wall, the net force exerted is\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{\\delta t} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} d p_{x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d p_{y} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d p_{z} f_{1}(\\vec{p})\\left(A \\frac{p_{x}}{m} \\delta t\\right)\\left(2 p_{x}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs only particles with velocities directed towards the wall will hit it, the first integral is over half of the range of $p_{x} .$ Since the integrand is even in $p_{x}$, this restriction can be removed by dividing the full integral by $2 .$ The pressure $P$ is then obtained from the force per unit area as\n\n$$\nP=\\frac{F}{A}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p} f_{1}(\\vec{p}) \\frac{p_{x}^{2}}{m}=\\frac{1}{m} \\int d^{3} \\vec{p} p_{x}^{2} n\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{2 \\pi m}\\right)^{3 / 2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^{2}}{2 m}\\right)=\\frac{n}{\\beta}\n$$\n\nwhere eq.(III.56) is used for the equilibrium form of $f_{1}$. Comparing with the standard equation of state, $P V=N k_{B} T$, for an ideal gas, leads to the identification, $\\beta=1 / k_{B} T$\n\n(4) Entropy: As discussed earlier, the Boltzmann H-function is closely related to the information content of the one-particle PDF $\\rho_{1} .$ We can also define a corresponding Boltzmann entropy,\n\n$$\nS_{B}(t)=-k_{B} \\mathrm{H}(t)\n$$\n\nwhere the constant $k_{B}$ reflects the historical origins of entropy. The H-theorem implies that $S_{B}$ can only increase with time in approaching equilibrium. It has the further advantage of being defined through eq.(III.42) for situations that are clearly out of equilibrium. For a gas in equilibrium in a box of volume $V$, from eq.(III.56), we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{H} &=V \\int d^{3} \\vec{p} f_{1}(\\vec{p}) \\ln f_{1}(\\vec{p}) \\\\\n&=V \\int d^{3} \\vec{p} \\frac{N}{V}\\left(2 \\pi m k_{B} T\\right)^{-3 / 2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{p^{2}}{2 m k_{B} T}\\right)\\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{n}{\\left(2 \\pi m k_{B} T\\right)^{3 / 2}}\\right)-\\frac{p^{2}}{2 m k_{B} T}\\right] \\\\\n&=N\\left[\\ln \\left(\\frac{n}{\\left(2 \\pi m k_{B} T\\right)^{3 / 2}}\\right)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe entropy is now identified as\n\n$$\nS_{B}=-k_{B} \\mathrm{H}=N k_{B}\\left[\\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{3}{2} \\ln \\left(2 \\pi m k_{B} T\\right)-\\ln \\left(\\frac{N}{V}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe thermodynamic relation, $T d S_{B}=d E+P d V$, implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial T}\\right|_{V} &=\\left.T \\frac{\\partial S_{B}}{\\partial T}\\right|_{V}=\\frac{3}{2} N k_{B} \\\\\nP+\\left.\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial V}\\right|_{T} &=\\left.T \\frac{\\partial S_{B}}{\\partial V}\\right|_{T}=\\frac{N k_{B} T}{V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe usual properties of a monatomic ideal gas, $P V=N k_{B} T$, and $E=3 N k_{B} T / 2$, can now be obtained from the above equations. Also note that for this classical gas, the zero temperature limit of the entropy in eq.(III.67) is not independent of the density $n$, in violation of the third law of thermodynamics.

For example, knowledge of the one particle distribution is sufficient for computing the pressure of a gas. A one particle density refers to the expectation value of finding any of the $N$ particles at location $\\vec{q}$, with momentum $\\vec{p}$, at time $t$, which is computed from the full density $\\rho$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{1}(\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}, t) &=\\left\\langle\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_{i}\\right) \\delta^{3}\\left(\\vec{q}-\\vec{q}_{i}\\right)\\right\\rangle \\\\\n&=N \\int \\prod_{i=2}^{N} d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i} \\rho\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}=\\vec{p}, \\vec{q}_{1}=\\vec{q}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, \\cdots, \\vec{p}_{N}, \\vec{q}_{N}, t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo obtain the second identity above, we used the first pair of delta functions to perform one set of integrals, and then assumed that the density is symmetric with respect to permuting the particles. Similarly, a two particle density can be computed from\n\n$$\nf_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, t\\right)=N(N-1) \\int \\prod_{i=3}^{N} d V_{i} \\rho\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, \\cdots, \\vec{p}_{N}, \\vec{q}_{N}, t\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $d V_{i}=d^{3} \\vec{p}_{i} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{i}$ is the contribution of particle $i$ to phase space volume. The general $s$ -particle density is defined by\n\n$$\nf_{s}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{q}_{s}, t\\right)=\\frac{N !}{(N-s) !} \\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\rho(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}, t)=\\frac{N !}{(N-s) !} \\rho_{s}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\cdots, \\vec{q}_{s}, t\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho_{s}$ is a standard unconditional $P D F$ for the coordinates of $s$ particles, and $\\rho_{N} \\equiv \\rho$ While $\\rho_{s}$ is properly normalized to unity when integrated over all its variables, the $s$ particle density has a normalization of $N ! /(N-s) ! . \\quad$ We shall use the two quantities interchangeably.\n\nThe evolution of the few-body densities is governed by the BBGKY hierarchy of equations attributed to Bogoliubov, Born, Green, Kirkwood, and Yvon. The simplest non-trivial Hamiltonian studied in kinetic theory is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q})=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left[\\frac{\\vec{p}_{i}{ }^{2}}{2 m}+U\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}\\right)\\right]+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(i, j)=1}^{N} \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis Hamiltonian provides an adequate description of a weakly interacting gas. In addition to the classical kinetic energy of particles of mass $m$, it contains an external potential $U$, and a two-body interaction $\\mathcal{V}$, between the particles. In principle, three and higher body interactions should also be included for a realistic description, but they are not very important in the dilute gas (nearly ideal) limit.\n\nFor evaluating the time evolution of $f_{s}$, it is convenient to divide the Hamiltonian into\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{H}_{s}+\\mathcal{H}_{N-s}+\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{s}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{N-s}$ include only interactions among each group of particles,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathcal{H}_{s}=\\sum_{n=1}^{s}\\left[\\frac{\\vec{p}_{n}^{2}}{2 m}+U\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}\\right)\\right]+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(n, m)=1}^{s} \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{m}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathcal{H}_{N-s}=\\sum_{i=s+1}^{N}\\left[\\frac{\\vec{p}_{i}^{2}}{2 m}+U\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}\\right)\\right]+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{(i, j)=s+1}^{N} \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{i}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhile the interparticle interactions are contained in\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\sum_{i=s+1}^{N} \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom eq.(III.18), the time evolution of $f_{s}\\left(\\right.$ or $\\left.\\rho_{s}\\right)$ is obtained as\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}}{\\partial t}=\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}=-\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i}\\left\\{\\rho, \\mathcal{H}_{s}+\\mathcal{H}_{N-s}+\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere eq.(III.9) is used for the evolution of $\\rho$. The three Poisson brackets in eq.(III.23) will now be evaluated in turn. Since the first $s$ coordinates are not integrated, the order of integrations and differentiations for the Poisson bracket may be reversed, and\n\n$$\n\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i}\\left\\{\\rho, \\mathcal{H}_{s}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left(\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\rho\\right), \\mathcal{H}_{s}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\rho_{s}, \\mathcal{H}_{s}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWriting the Poisson brackets explicitly, the second term of eq.(III.23) takes the form\n\n$$\n-\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i}\\left\\{\\rho, \\mathcal{H}_{N-s}\\right\\}=\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}_{N-s}}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}}-\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}_{N-s}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}}\\right]\n$$\n\n(using eq.(III.21))\n\n$$\n=\\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\sum_{j=s+1}^{N}\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=s+1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{j}-\\vec{q}_{k}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{p}_{j}}{m}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nThe last equality is obtained after performing the integrations by part: The term multiplying $\\partial \\rho / \\partial \\vec{p}_{j}$ has no dependence on $\\vec{p}_{j}$, while $\\vec{p}_{j} / m$ does not depend on $\\vec{q}_{j}$. The final term in eq.(III.23), involving the Poisson bracket with $\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}}-\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}}\\right] \\\\\n=& \\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{n}} \\cdot \\sum_{j=s+1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{j}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{n}}+\\sum_{j=s+1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{j}} \\cdot \\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{j}-\\vec{q}_{n}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{j}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the sum over all particles has been subdivided into the two groups. (Note that $\\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$ in eq.(III.22) has no dependence on the momenta.) Integration by parts shows that the second term in the above expression is zero. The first term involves the sum of $(N-s)$ expressions that are equal by symmetry and simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(N-s) \\int \\prod_{i=s+1}^{N} d V_{i} \\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{s+1}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{n}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{n}} \\\\\n=&(N-s) \\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\int d V_{s+1} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{s+1}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{n}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{n}}\\left[\\int \\prod_{i=s+2}^{N} d V_{i} \\rho\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the quantity in the above square brackets is $\\rho_{s+1} .$ Thus, adding up eqs.(III.24), (III.25), and (III.26),\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s}}{\\partial t}-\\left\\{\\mathcal{H}_{s}, \\rho_{s}\\right\\}=(N-s) \\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\int d V_{s+1} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{s+1}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{n}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{s+1}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{n}}\n$$\n\nor in terms of the densities $f_{s}$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{s}}{\\partial t}-\\left\\{\\mathcal{H}_{s}, f_{s}\\right\\}=\\sum_{n=1}^{s} \\int d V_{s+1} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{n}-\\vec{q}_{s+1}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{n}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{s+1}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{n}}\n$$\n\nIn the absence of interactions with other particles, the density $\\rho_{s}$ for a group of $s$ particles evolves as the density of an incompressible fluid (as required by Liouville's theorem), and is described by the streaming terms on the left hand side of eq.(III.27). However, because of interactions with the remaining $N-s$ particles, the flow is modified by the collision terms on the right hand side. The collision integral is the sum of the terms corresponding to a potential collision of any of the particles in the group of $s$, with any of the remaining $N-s$ particles. To describe the probability of finding the additional particle that collides with a member of this group, the result must depend on the joint PDF of $s+1$ particles described by $\\rho_{s+1} .$ This results in a hierarchy of equations in which $\\partial \\rho_{1} / \\partial t$ depends on $\\rho_{2}, \\partial \\rho_{2} / \\partial t$ depends on $\\rho_{3}$, etc., which is at least as complicated as the original equation for the full phase space density. To proceed further, a physically motivated approximation for terminating the hierarchy is needed. \n\n\\section{III.D The Boltzmann Equation}\n\nTo estimate the relative importance of the different terms appearing in eqs.(III.28), let us examine the first two equations in the hierarchy,\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}+\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}\\right] f_{1}=\\int d V_{2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f_{2}}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n{\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}+\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}+\\frac{\\vec{p}_{2}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{2}}-\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}\\right)\\right] f_{2}=} \\\\\n\\int d V_{3}\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{3}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{3}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}\\right] f_{3}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nNote that two of the streaming terms in eq.(III.30) have been combined by using $\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right) / \\partial \\vec{q}_{1}=-\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right) / \\partial \\vec{q}_{2}$, which is valid for a symmetric potential such that $\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)=\\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right)$\n\n- Time scales: All terms within square brackets in the above equations have dimensions of inverse time, and we estimate their relative magnitudes by dimensional analysis, using typical velocities and length scales. The typical speed of a gas particle at room temperature is $v \\approx 10^{2} \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$. For terms involving the external potential $U$, or the inter-atomic potential $\\mathcal{V}$, an appropriate length scale can be extracted from the range of variations of the potential.\n\n(a) The terms proportional to\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{U}} \\sim \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}}\n$$\n\ninvolve spatial variations of the external potential $U(\\vec{q})$, which take place over macroscopic distances $L .$ We shall refer to the associated time $\\tau_{U}$, as an extrinsic time scale, as it can be made arbitrarily long by increasing system size. For a typical value of $L \\approx 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m}$, we get $\\tau_{U} \\approx L / v \\approx 10^{-5} s$\n\n(b) From the terms involving the inter-atomic potential $\\mathcal{V}$, we can extract two additional time scales, which are intrinsic to the gas under study. In particular, the collision duration\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{c}} \\sim \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial \\vec{q}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}}\n$$\n\nis the typical time over which two particles are within the effective range $d$, of their interaction. For short range interactions (including van der Waals and Lenard-Jones, despite their power law decaying tails), $d \\approx 10^{-10} m$ is of the order of a typical atomic size, resulting in $\\tau_{c} \\approx 10^{-12} s$. This is usually the shortest time scale in the problem. The analysis is somewhat more complicated for long range interactions, such as the Coulomb gas in a plasma. For a neutral plasma, the Debye screening length $\\lambda$ replaces $d$ in the above equation, as discussed in the problems.\n\n(c) There are also collision terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.28), which depend on $f_{s+1}$, and lead to an inverse time scale\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\times}} \\sim \\int d V \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial \\vec{q}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}} \\frac{f_{s+1}}{f_{s}} \\sim \\int d V \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial \\vec{q}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}} N \\frac{\\rho_{s+1}}{\\rho_{s}}\n$$\n\nThe integrals are only non-zero over the volume of the inter-particle potential $d^{3}$. The term $f_{s+1} / f_{s}$ is related to the probability of finding another particle per unit volume, which is roughly the particle density $n=N / V \\approx 10^{26} m^{-3} .$ We thus obtain the mean free time\n\n$$\n\\tau_{\\times} \\approx \\frac{\\tau_{c}}{n d^{3}} \\approx \\frac{1}{n v d^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhich is the typical distance a particle travels between collisions. For short range interactions, $\\tau_{\\times} \\approx 10^{-8} s$ is much longer than $\\tau_{c}$, and the collision terms on the right hand side of eqs.(III.28) are smaller by a factor of $n d^{3} \\approx\\left(10^{26} m^{-3}\\right)\\left(10^{-10} m\\right)^{3} \\approx 10^{-4}$. The Boltzmann equation is obtained for short range interactions in the dilute regime by exploiting $\\tau_{c} / \\tau_{\\times} \\approx n d^{3} \\ll 1 .$ (By contrast, for long range interactions such that $n d^{3} \\gg 1$, the Vlasov equation is obtained by dropping the collision terms on the left hand side, as discussed in the problems.) From the above discussion, it is apparent that eq.(III.29) is different from the rest of the hierarchy: It is the only one in which the collision terms are absent from the left hand side. For all other equations, the right hand side is smaller by a factor of $n d^{3}$, while in eq.(III.29) it may indeed dominate the left hand side. Thus a possible approximation scheme is to truncate the equations after the first two, by setting the right hand side of eq.(III.30) to zero.\n\nSetting the right hand side of the equation for $f_{2}$ to zero implies that the two body density evolves as in an isolated two-particle system. The relatively simple mechanical processes that govern this evolution result in streaming terms for $f_{2}$ which are proportional to both $\\tau_{U}^{-1}$ and $\\tau_{c}^{-1} .$ The two sets of terms can be more or less treated independently: the former describe the evolution of the center of mass of the two particles, while the latter govern the dependence on relative coordinates. The density $f_{2}$ is proportional to the joint PDF $\\rho_{2}$ for finding one particle at $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)$, and another at $\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}\\right)$, at the same time $t .$ It is reasonable to expect that at distances much larger than the range of the potential $\\mathcal{V}$, the particles are independent, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\rho_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, t\\right) \\longrightarrow \\rho_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right) \\rho_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, t\\right), \\text { or } \\\\\nf_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, t\\right) \\longrightarrow f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{2}, t\\right), \\quad \\text { for } \\quad\\left|\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{1}\\right| \\gg d\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe above statement should be true even for situations out of equilibrium. For example, imagine that the gas particles in a chamber are suddenly allowed to invade an empty volume after the removal of a barrier. The density $f_{1}$ will undergo a complicated evolution, and its relaxation time will be at least comparable to $\\tau_{U} .$ The two particle density $f_{2}$, will also reach its final value at a comparable time interval. However, it is expected to relax to a form similar to eq.(III.32) over a much shorter time of the order of $\\tau_{c}$.\n\nFor the collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29), we actually need the precise dependence of $f_{2}$ on the relative coordinates and momenta at separations comparable to $d$. At time intervals longer than $\\tau_{c}$ (but possibly shorter than $\\left.\\tau_{U}\\right)$, the 'steady state' behavior of $f_{2}$ at small relative distances is obtained by equating the largest streaming terms in eq.(III.30), i.e.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}+\\frac{\\vec{p}_{2}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{2}}-\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}\\right)\\right] f_{2}=0\n$$\n\nWe expect $f_{2}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{2}\\right)$ to have slow variations over the center of mass coordinate $\\vec{Q}=\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}+\\right.$ $\\left.\\vec{q}_{2}\\right) / 2$, and large variations over the relative coordinate $\\vec{q}=\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{1} .$ Therefore, $\\partial f_{2} / \\partial \\vec{q} \\gg$ $\\partial f_{2} / \\partial \\vec{Q}$, and $\\partial f_{2} / \\vec{q}_{2} \\approx-\\partial f_{2} / \\partial \\vec{q}_{1} \\approx \\partial f_{2} / \\partial \\vec{q}$, leading to\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}\\right) f_{2}=-\\left(\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}}{m}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}} f_{2}\n$$\n\nThe above equation provides a precise mathematical expression for how $f_{2}$ is constrained along the trajectories that describe the collision of the two particles.\n\nThe collision term on the right hand side of eq.(III.29) can now be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.\\frac{d f_{1}}{d t}\\right|_{\\text {coll. }} &=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{3} \\vec{q}_{2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}\\left(\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right)}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{2}}\\right) f_{2} \\\\\n& \\approx \\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{3} \\vec{q}\\left(\\frac{\\vec{p}_{2}-\\vec{p}_{1}}{m}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}} f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q} ; t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first identity if obtained from eq.(III.29) by noting that the added term proportional to $\\partial f_{2} / \\partial \\vec{p}_{2}$ is a complete derivative and integrates to zero, while the second equality follows from eq.(III.34), after the change of variables to $\\vec{q}=\\vec{q}_{2}-\\vec{q}_{1}$. (Since it relies on establishing the 'steady state' in the relative coordinates, this approximation is valid as long as we examine events in time with a resolution longer than $\\tau_{c}$.)\n\n- Kinematics of collision and scattering: The integrand in eq.(III.35) is a derivative of $f_{2}$ with respect to $\\vec{q}$ along the direction of relative motion $\\vec{p}=\\vec{p}_{2}-\\vec{p}_{1}$, of the colliding particles. To perform this integration we introduce a convenient coordinate system for $\\vec{q}$, guided by the formalism used to describe the scattering of particles. Naturally, we choose one axis to be parallel to $\\vec{p}_{2}-\\vec{p}_{1}$, with the corresponding coordinate $a$ which is negative before a collision, and positive afterwards. The other two coordinates of $\\vec{q}$ are represented by an impact vector $\\vec{b}$ which is $\\overrightarrow{0}$ for a head-on collision $\\left(\\left[\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}\\right] \\|\\left[\\vec{q}_{1}-\\vec{q}_{2}\\right]\\right) .$ We can now integrate over $a$ to get\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d f_{1}}{d t}\\right|_{\\text {coll. }}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},+; t\\right)-f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}\\right| / m$ is the relative speed of the two particles, with $(\\vec{b},-)$ and $(\\vec{b},+)$ referring to relative coordinates before and after the collision. Note that $d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|$ is just the flux of particles impinging on the element of area $d^{2} \\vec{b}$\n\nIn principle, the integration over $a$ is from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, but as the variations of $f_{2}$ are only significant over the interaction range $d$, we can evaluate the above quantities at separations of a few $d$ from the collision point. This is a good compromise, allowing us to evaluate $f_{2}$ away from the collisions, but at small enough separations so that we can ignore the difference between $\\vec{q}_{1}$ and $\\vec{q}_{2}$. This amounts to a coarse-graining in space which eliminates variations on scales finer than $d .$ With these provisos, it is tempting to close the equation for $f_{1}$, by using the assumption of uncorrelated particles in eq.(III.32). Clearly some care is necessary as a naive substitution gives zero! The key observation is that the densities $f_{2}$ for situations corresponding to before and after the collision have to be treated differently. For example, soon after opening of the slot separating empty and full gas containers, the momenta of the gas particles are likely to point away from the slot. Collisions will tend to randomize momenta, yielding a more isotropic distribution. However, the densities $f_{2}$ before and after the collision are related by streaming, implying that $f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},+; t\\right)=f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)$, where $\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}$ are momenta whose collision at an impact vector $\\vec{b}$ results in production of outgoing particles with momenta $\\vec{p}_{1}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}$. They can be obtained using time reversal symmetry, by integrating the equations of motion for incoming colliding particles of momenta $-\\vec{p}_{1}$ and $-\\vec{p}_{2} .$ In terms of these momenta, we can write\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d f_{1}}{d t}\\right|_{\\text {coll. }}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\vec{b}\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)-f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nIt is sometimes more convenient to describe the scattering of two particles in terms of the relative momenta $\\vec{p}=\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}$ and $\\vec{p}^{\\prime}=\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}-\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}$, before and after the collision. For a given $\\vec{b}$, the initial momentum $\\vec{p}$ is deterministically transformed to the final momentum $\\vec{p}^{\\prime} .$ To find the functional form $\\vec{p}^{\\prime}(|\\vec{p}|, \\vec{b})$, one must integrate the equations of motion. However, it is possible to make some general statements based on conservation laws: In elastic collisions, the magnitude of $\\vec{p}$ is preserved, and it merely rotates to a final direction indicated by the angles $(\\theta, \\phi) \\equiv \\hat{\\Omega}(\\vec{b})$ (a unit vector) in spherical coordinates. Since there is a one to one correspondence between the impact vector $\\vec{b}$, and the solid angle $\\Omega$, we make a change of variables between the two, resulting in\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d f_{1}}{d t}\\right|_{\\text {coll. }}=\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\Omega\\left|\\frac{d \\sigma}{d \\Omega}\\right|\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)-f_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe Jacobian of this transformation, $|d \\sigma / d \\Omega|$, has dimensions of area, and is known as the differential cross-section. It is equal to the area presented to an incoming beam which scatters into the solid angle $\\Omega .$ The out-going momenta $\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}$ in eq.(III.38) are now obtained from the two conditions $\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}+\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}=\\vec{p}_{1}+\\vec{p}_{2}$ (conservation of momentum), and $\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}-\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}=\\left|\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}\\right| \\hat{\\Omega}(\\vec{b})($ conservation of energy $)$, as\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}=\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}+\\vec{p}_{2}+\\left|\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}\\right| \\hat{\\Omega}(\\vec{b})\\right) / 2 \\\\\n\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}=\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}+\\vec{p}_{2}-\\left|\\vec{p}_{1}-\\vec{p}_{2}\\right| \\hat{\\Omega}(\\vec{b})\\right) / 2\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFor the scattering of two hard spheres of diameter $D$, it is easy to show that the scattering angle is related to the impact parameter $b$ by $\\cos (\\theta / 2)=b / D$ for all $\\phi .$ The differential cross-section is then obtained from\n\n$$\nd^{2} \\sigma=b d b d \\phi=D \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) D \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\frac{d \\theta}{2} d \\phi=\\frac{D^{2}}{4} \\sin \\theta d \\theta d \\phi=\\frac{D^{2}}{4} d^{2} \\Omega\n$$\n\n(Note that the solid angle in three dimensions is given by $\\left.d^{2} \\Omega=\\sin \\theta d \\theta d \\phi .\\right)$ Integrating over all angles leads to the total cross-section of $\\sigma=\\pi D^{2}$, which is evidently correct. The differential cross-section for hard spheres is independent of both $\\theta$ and $|\\vec{P}| .$ This is not the case for soft potentials. For example, the Coulomb potential $\\mathcal{V}=e^{2} /|\\vec{Q}|$ leads to\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{d \\sigma}{d \\Omega}\\right|=\\left(\\frac{m e^{2}}{2|\\vec{P}|^{2} \\sin ^{2}(\\theta / 2)}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n(The dependence on $|\\vec{P}|$ can be justified by obtaining a distance of closest approach from $\\left.|\\vec{P}|^{2} / m+e^{2} / b \\approx 0 .\\right)$\n\n- The Boltzmann equation is obtained from eq.(III.38) after the substitution\n\n$$\nf_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{b},-; t\\right)=f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right) \\cdot f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right)\n$$\n\nknown as the assumption of molecular chaos. Note that even if one starts with an uncorrelated initial probability distribution for particles, there is no guarantee that correlations are not generated as a result of collisions. The final result is the following closed form equation for $f_{1}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}-\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{p}_{1}}+\\frac{\\vec{p}_{1}}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\vec{q}_{1}}\\right] f_{1}=} \\\\\n&-\\int d^{3} \\vec{p}_{2} d^{2} \\Omega\\left|\\frac{d \\sigma}{d \\Omega}\\right|\\left|\\vec{v}_{1}-\\vec{v}_{2}\\right|\\left[f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right)-f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}, \\vec{q}_{1}, t\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nGiven the complexity of the above 'derivation' of the Boltzmann equation, it is appropriate to provide a heuristic explanation. The streaming terms on the left hand side of the equation describe the motion of a single particle in the external potential $U$. The collision terms on the right hand side have a simple physical interpretation: The probability of finding a particle of momentum $\\vec{p}_{1}$ at $\\vec{q}_{1}$ is suddenly altered if it undergoes a collision with another particle of momentum $\\vec{p}_{2}$. The probability of such a collision is the product of kinematic factors described by the differential cross-section $|d \\sigma / d \\Omega|$, the 'flux' of incident particles proportional to $\\left|\\vec{v}_{2}-\\vec{v}_{1}\\right|$, and the joint probability of finding the two particles, approximated by $f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right) f_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right) .$ The first term on the right hand side of eq.(III.41) subtracts this probability and integrates over all possible momenta and solid angles describing the collision. The second term represents an addition to the probability which results from the inverse process: A particle can suddenly appear with coordinates $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{q}_{1}\\right)$ as a result of a collision between two particles initially with momenta $\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime} .$ The cross-section, and the momenta $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\vec{p}_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$ may have a complicated dependence on $\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}, \\vec{p}_{2}\\right)$ and $\\Omega$, determined by the specific form of the potential $\\mathcal{V}$. Remarkably, various equilibrium properties of the gas are quite independent of this potential.

Class materials have been published for entire majors leading some to speculate that we may see a drop in post-secondary education prices. Maybe there would be a revolution where a flood of skilled engineers enter the workforce to solve the world's pressing challenges. While instructional videos have easily generated billions of dollars in value over the past decades, they don't necessarily produce as radical change as many have imagined. While there are many times as much material available as is necessary to graduate a student, there are not enough teachers/professors in the world for all of the would-be learners. That is because independent learning is inherently hard. See the [two sigma problem](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf). There will always be exceptional cases where an individual implements free resources and becomes a rockstar. Is this possible? sure. Likely? based on the proportion of rockstars in the population, no.\r\n\r\nInternet-native course content has become dramatically more effective over the past decade, but it may yet underserve a majority of students. It can also involve a great deal of time investment from instructors to generate quality content. At best, effective online learning management systems have minimized lost time for many amid learning interruptions during the 2020 pandemic. At worst however, the impact of distance has dramatically [lengthened instructer-student feedback loops](https://www.bradley.edu/sites/it/departments/ldt/it-tools/sakai/principles/timely-feedback/) leading to massive learning opportunity lost. We do not yet know the scale of this impact, but as the entire globe is piecing together new solutions for remote learning the rapid evolution of remote learning may yield radically different prevailing systems of thought.\r\n\r\nEach discipline will be impacted differently.

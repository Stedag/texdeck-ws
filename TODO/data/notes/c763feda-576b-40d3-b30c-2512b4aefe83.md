# Index of Courses

Degree components tabulated below reflect a conventional undergraduate program in physics minus general education requirements

The "[[Anki]] coverage" below indicates how much of the material of a course is/can be covered by a single set of flashcards. Two different courses in the same subject can take vastly different paths. Upper level courses tend to have a smaller subset of common concepts, dialects, and conventions. Therefore the estimated max coverage is a heuristic judgement. This will be refined over time.

The Physics GRE course weightings based on ETS's subject weightings and my own sense of the curriculum distribution. It is also a heuristic judgement, neither a prescription or reccomended by ETS.
